      "['I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group. It\\'s still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe. The C320 \"Sport\" needs to have it\\'s suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. The C240\\'s 6-speed wouldn\\'t hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be \"fixed\" first.\\n\\nThat said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0. The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. The single thing I don\\'t like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. This trim doesn\\'t match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K. The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners.\\n\\nThe BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I\\'m (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants. I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.\\n\\nThe Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular. This car\\'s main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. Otherwise a standout.\\n\\nLexus ES300. Nice, but not my type of car at all. This is one for the Buick set. The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn\\'t look like a 35K car (grown). The interior is gawd-awful. Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start. In their defense Toyota didn\\'t initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job.\\n\\nThe CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here. I\\'ve seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better. Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues. The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid. If you\\'re going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? The seats are very good though, as is the handling. A work in progress.\\n\\nThe G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.\\n\\nDon\\'t really care much for the X-Type. If I were a Jaguar man I\\'d be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one. They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I\\'ve read where they\\'re thinking about selling it here! Hell no. The car should have been rwd not awd. Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi. Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd. It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar \"leaper\" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.\\n\\nThe Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come. This new 300M \"Special\" is truly a good looking car inside and out. One problem: Where is the performance???? A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. Something is not right here. Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car. The heavier E320 with less power is faster. I still like this car, but it\\'s no lust object once you get past the great styling.\\n\\nM', \"I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.\", 'Great handling, RWD, excellent engine and the best warranty around. Easy winner.', \"And no manual tranny. That may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.\\n\\nSo IMO, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'.\", \"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from. Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan. Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!\\n\\nhungrywhale... I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!\", \"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider.\", \"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto. I don't care how fast it is. It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car.\", \"I understand it's not about the speed. I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark. What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it. Will I buy an auto-equipped G? In all likelihood, no. I desperately want to drive the 6 speed.\", \"It sounds like you know why I won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.\", 'Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan?

Sad.\\nIf or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment.\"\\n\\nRiez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife\\'s) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That\\'s belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW\\'s etc. with automatics.\\n\\nWhen I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I\\'m leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.\\n\\nI do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.\\n\\nI have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many \"experts\" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven\\'t even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW \"supportors\" don\\'t even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make \"unsupported\" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund\\'s BMW 3-series discussion). I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn\\'t classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.\\n\\nAgain, I\\'m not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I\\'m interested in and make my choice from there. I\\'m also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I\\'m shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.\\n\\nCheers!', \"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them\\n\\nBut any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny.

Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class.\", \"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it. Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one. They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti.\", \"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though.\\n\\nAlso, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies.\", '\"I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus\"\\n\\nHow else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then?\\n\\nReasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so.', \"I couldn't have said it better myself.

Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans. But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans.

Let me know when you do. I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.\\n\\nIt does make a difference being married. (LOL! see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board). First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help!

Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.\\n\\nAlthough I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240. Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.\\n\\nBoth cars are relative newcommers to the market. The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.\\n\\nSince you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi. As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer. They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running. Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ...\", \"It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation. People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable. These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.\\n\\n1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out. Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.\\n\\nSecondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year. I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.\\n\\nThese two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree.\", \"There is not much to debate on this subject. If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese. If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european. The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else. You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle. There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world. Sadly for them those days are passing. The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's) While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up.\", 'gave up nationality based generalizations a couple of years ago.', \"I'm interested more towards performance than luxury.

I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.\\n\\nI understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you.

Excitement and slushbox don\\'t seem to be compatible. I can\\'t get too excited about FWDers. Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.\\n\\nNot sure what you mean about \"the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)\".\\n\\nVery powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering. Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate. The laws of physics remain. When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you\\'ll get some torque steering.\\n\\nDo you have kids? Plan to in near future? If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles? They can be a bit more exciting.', '\"Excitement and slushbox don\\'t seem to be compatible.\"\\n\\nAgreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don\\'t seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving.', \"Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering? This varies the power steering boost as with the speed. Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though). This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied. And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars. It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels.\", 'cybersol... There are two types. Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed. I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds. Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.\\n\\nHere is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says: \"Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion\". This is off the tech specs on page 30. I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure. So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret. This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S.', \"Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist. They do not say how it varies.\\n\\nBut on the Acura website. TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:\\n\\n\\nSteering Type\\n\\nTL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering\\n\\n3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering\\n\\n\\nHere's the link if you want to check it out:\\n\\nhttp://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.asp\\n\\n\\nHard to find, but not a secret.\", \"cybersol... From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs. Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting. And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.\\n\\nBut keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system. It is due to other factors. Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers. Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts. Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.\\n\\nFrom standing start, floor your car. See if the wheel pulls in one direction. You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering. You can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve. Wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct.\", \"So, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to Audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an Audi A4 3.0 to an Audi S4...

Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?\\n\\nOh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?\", \"Have you driven them both? The S4 really moves. Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.\\n\\nYet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year.

The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm. So this is why it scoots.\\n\\nThe new S4 should be really nice. If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing. It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out. So many decisions.\\n\\nHave fun making the right one for you!\", 'Not so fast. There is merit to the \"nationality based\" debate. Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars. The reason is cultural.\\n\\nAmericans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit. We take chances. Its not in our nature to \"accept\" things as they are. I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren\\'t we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life. As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily. Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough. Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else. The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades. As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV\\'s, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..\\n\\nThe Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old. They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo. We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II. I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me. What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect. There is very little innovation or risk taking. That is why the cars are so bland. When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan? VCR\\'s, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese. The same goes for cars. Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they\\'re going to get!).\\n\\nAnyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break. Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances. And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.\\n\\nI\\'ll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing.', \"The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda.\\n\\nAnd many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?\\n\\nSo where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations.\", \"Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time.

And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95. I base this on a number of things. For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic. The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258. And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94. Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better. We&#146;ll see. . . (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90. This was my previous car.

Nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 A4 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the S4.

Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, \\'This thing is really good in the curves!\\' It\\'s a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either. Our test car\\'s optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there\\'s a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.\"\\n\\nThey also say of its suspension, \"Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be \\'connected but relaxed,\\'and that seems to wrap it up nicely. The ride is about as smooth as you\\'ll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.\"\\n\\nOf the Audi\\'s handling, they say, \"Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks. It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive. It\\'s a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn\\'t feel very sporty doing it, despite our car\\'s having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced \\'considerable excitement,\\' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others. And again, \\'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,\\' one driver noted. The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.\"\\n\\nSTEERING:\\nMotor Trend says of the X-TYPE\\'s ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, \"The car\\'s best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering. In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series. Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel. With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track. The only all-wheel-drive car we\\'ve ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.\"\\n\\nThe Audi\\'s steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, \"rubbery\" in feeling, and C&D said that the \"steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.\"\\n\\nCar&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE \"is nothing short of terrific.\" They call it \"enthusiast goods\".\\n\\nForbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, \"Jaguar engineers boast it\\'s the best steering system they\\'ve ever had on any model. We agree.\"\\n\\nALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:\\nAudi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now. Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4. It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available. Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6. Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.\\n\\nJaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected. This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car. Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.\\n\\nForbes stated of the X-TYPE\\'s AWD, \"The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi\\'s vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.\"\\n\\nRoad&Track said that, \"...The Jag is better balanced. It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through. It\\'s a safe and secure feeling that signals what\\'s about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust\"\\n\\nBRAKING:\\nThe X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.\\n\\nRoad & Track said, \"In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)\" In another one of their articles, they say, \"The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.\"\\n\\nCar & Driver also said, \"A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE\\'s handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive. Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle. The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.\"\\n\\nBy comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag. The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet. An SLK32 AMG does', 'it in 127 feet.\\n\\n-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 braking distance from 60 mph: 118 ft.\\n-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro braking distance from 60 mph: 137 ft.\\n\\nITERIOR:\\nHere is where the statements become subjective, and anything I say here other than what is quoted from others is just my opinion.\\n\\nBoth the Audi and the Jaguar offer excellent interiors. The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details. I really like the interiors of both cars. The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi\\'s air vents seems more resilient, etc.\\n\\nRoad&Track said that, \"Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there\\'s birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag\\'s interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges.\" They say it \"may be an \\'entry level\\' model, but you wouldn\\'t know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.\"\\n\\nMotor Trend says the X-TYPE \"has great styling inside and out\", and says specifically that the interior is \"soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint. The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel. HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It\\'s pure Jag inside and out.\"\\n\\nCar&Driver says \"As you\\'d expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird\\'s-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors. Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.\"\\n_____________________________\\n\\neaweg-\\n\\nMy opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more. It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason. It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader. AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood. You must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything I have read and experienced with the X-TYPE says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout. Like you said, to each their own.', 'you can lease an X-type for next to nothing...high incentives.', 'Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature!

I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn\\'t come to grips with it.\\n\\nI found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller. i think it is unfair and untrue to say the \"Ford\" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not. The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).\\n\\nthe jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch. the steering, IMO, was better than almost all.

I don\\'t think there is \"a best\" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences. They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.\\n\\nOn the X-TYPE article:\\nI read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end. Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don\\'t have any of those problems. I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems. The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars. They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one. Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.\\n\\nYes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability. Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.\\n\\nI can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all. It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I\\'ve had it. I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.\\n\\nAgain, it is all personal preference. When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right. I hadn\\'t even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect. Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect. The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.\\n\\nAnd if anyone is paying off the media it\\'s BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most. I don\\'t think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they\\'ve had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)\\n\\nAnd, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board. Take care of your car!\\n____________________________\\n\\nBlueguydotcom-\\n\\nI actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it. The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!). It\\'s also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher. I\\'d like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year. Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own. Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier.', 'Is the Jag even selling? I see far more Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes than Jag X-types. And i live in car crazy so-cal.', \"The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April.

The overall performance is similar to the G35, though it gets edged out in most categories. The biggest difference is FWD vs. RWD. I spent quite a bit of time in a TL-S when shopping recently. I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice.

Is it BMW's fault they are so wise to spread their costs across so many variants and give buyers so many choices? I say you could also add Z3 sales to the mix, too!\", 'Oh, that\\'s too bad. It\\'s also too bad that they failed to notice that:\\n\\n-The X-TYPE does have an indash CD-player, which is standard on 3.0 litre models.\\n\\n-Out of the group of European sport sedans (e.g. BMW 3, Mercedes-Benz C, Audi A4) the Jaguar X has the most powerful engines.\\n\\n-The Jaguar Alpine sound system is rated very highly. The auto\\'s section of my newspaper rated the Jaguar Alpine system the top system out of premium European cars in a big comparison test of car stereos. Lexus won the Japanese premium car sound system category with its ML system.\\n\\n-The car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the C-320 Sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the 3-Series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - Car&Driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - Road&Track). With its AWD, it can corner like no other car.\\n\\n-Braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the Porsche 911 GT2 (116 feet), at 118 feet. Thus, it stops in the same distance as a smaller BMW M-Roadster (118 ft.). Brakes are from the larger S-TYPE.\\n\\n-Connoly leather and wood are all standard in the Jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor\\'s models.\\n\\n-It has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.\\n\\n-Synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for Audi\\'s A6 and new A8, which are \"industry leading\" according to many.\\n\\n-The X-TYPE does weigh a little more than a RWD car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its AWD, but that doesn\\'t seem to hurt its performance. It actually helps it in many ways. Also, for instance, it weighs less than an Audi A4, Cadillac CTS, and Lincoln LS.\\n\\n-There is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers. Plus, it\\'s a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it. Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE\\'s engine makes. There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.\\n\\n-Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use. I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.\\n\\n-Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc. Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered. Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.\\n\\nAbout the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn\\'t have are memory seats. Beyond those, it\\'s one hellofa car. I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar\\'s sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren\\'t a great car.\\n______________________________________\\n\\nOn the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article.

I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don\\'t feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch). Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own. Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars. As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn\\'t say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.\\n\\nBTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE. Sorry buddy, but you\\'re in the minority on this one. However, European Car\\'s own final words on their X-TYPE test were:\\n\\n\"Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle.

Ya gotta stay calm. Did you notice in your most recent post you did write \"over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.\"\\n\\nHave you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written? The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America. Don\\'t believe it has \"won\" a single comparison test.

Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.\\n\\nCan you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?\\n\\nAnd what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is? I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc. To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol. But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance. Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator. Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results. The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor.', 'jagboyxtype... Do you read MT or R&T?\\n\\nCheck out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend. MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison. In 10 areas of their \"Report Card\", the Jag wins just one, styling. Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value. Track results mediocre. Fourth place 0-60 mph time. 2nd slowest slalom time. Worst braking result. They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.\\n\\nCheck out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track. R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison. X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings. They tested a loaded $46,510 one.\\n\\nDoes that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT? Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there? And test driving the X-type against its competitors?', 'Isn\\'t that comparo a little bit much? I mean how does a \"almost a 1/2 second\" = \"throat raming\" or \"pummelling\" ? I would expect the Jaguar to be faster with a stick and the Benz with an auto.

C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.\\n\\nNotice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.\\n\\nPushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me.

You may check out AutoWeek\\'s review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by Autocar including their \"Autocar Book\" all about the X-TYPE. I never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn\\'t have very solid and rigid structures nor did I try to imply that, but at the moment, the Jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.\\n\\nAlso, as riez would say, \"I did not write the article\". The reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the X-TYPE beating the C-Class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times. Take braking (\"top drawer\" for the X-TYPE), or how they said the cars felt when being driven.\\n____________________________________\\n\\nRiez-\\n\\nI pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself. Listen to what you\\'ve been sayin: \"Car & Driver said this, and MotorTrend said this, and Road & Track said this\". Granted, I have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which I even do here), but you\\'ve taken it to an extreme.\\n\\n\"Do you read MT or R&T?\" you ask me.\\nSometimes I do, but only for entertainment purposes. Why? Because I do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions. And I am not the only one who feels that way. ABC News, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests. They use the Ford Focus and Car&Driver and MotorTrend\\'s opinions of the car as an example:\\n\\n\"For example, in January, Car and Driver listed the Ford Focus among its \\'10 Best Cars of the Year.\\' It never mentioned that Ford had recalled the Focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. Also, just this month, when Motor Trend\\'s review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the Focus. (It currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that Motor Trend could have known of when it went to press.)\"\\nhttp://www.abcnews.com\\n\\nHmmm. Six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the Focus is a favorite among car magazines like Car&Driver and MotorTrend. Well, they can have it, and I\\'m sure you think it\\'s a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.\\n\\nABC also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars. Even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said \"there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press\". MotorTrend\\'s own C. Van Tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.\\n\\nThe warning at the end of the article reads: \"So far, the big magazines don\\'t seem to have changed their policies. So, be aware: When you read and see reviews of this year\\'s models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who\\'ve been fed and fueled by the car companies.\"\\n\\nIt can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. This is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.\\n\\n\"Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written?\" you also ask me. Yes, I have. European Car\\'s own review of the X-TYPE is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. Road&Track\\'s review of the X-TYPE is also very complementary. Car&Driver tested the X-TYPE\\'s 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about \"enthusiast goods\" of the car. MotorTrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say \"This new X is one shaggy Jaggy\" and \"I\\'m anxious to try out the upcoming R version of the X-TYPE, because this is a very good sport sedan\". AutoWeek liked the car and decided that \"X\" was definitely an addition to the \"A\", \"C\", and \"3\" in the sport sedan equation. Forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. A vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the X-TYPE. And again, Autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the \"Most Important Jaguar Ever\" and said that between it and a 330i, they don\\'t know which one they would choose - \"it\\'s that close\".\\n\\nYou mention \"American\" tests in your posts. I must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the X-TYPE from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? They are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? There are people from all over the world here at Edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?\\n\\nOn the matter of that Road&Track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:\\n\"So how, you ask, did a car as nice as the Jaguar X-TYPE end up second to last in this great big comparison test? That\\'s easy: Price.\"\\nNotice that they happened to also have loaded their X-TYPE with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. Yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the Jaguar was. The BMW, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the Mercedes-Benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a CD player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the Jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). A test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment. The X-TYPE had much more than any of the other cars in the test did. A better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly. Take note that both the Saab and the Mercedes-Benz have higher starting prices than the Jaguar, and that the Jag\\'s starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars. AWD is also standard on the Jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped. La', '<continued>Later in that same R&T issue, they happen to have purchased, out of all those cars, a long-term X-TYPE.\\n\\nAlso, on price, let\\'s not complain about the X-TYPE when Road&Track\\'s $39,804 (and I count that as near $40,000, wouldn\\'t you?) BMW 330i does not even come with power seats in another comparo (page 74 of their \"Road Test Annual 2002\").\\n\\n\\nSo what else did R&T say about the X-TYPE in that 11 car test? How about \"Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn\\'t work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkie-talkies we all carry and said, \\'This thing is really good in the curves.\\' It\\'s a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either...our test car\\'s optional 3.0-litre 4-cam V-6 put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort...Overall, the X-TYPE is a comfortable, pleasent and useful car with a well-developed chassis...It\\'s a good all-rounder with, probably just as much British charm as most modern drivers really want. Independent of price, it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings.\" As a side note, they also say, \"The Jag\\'s interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivered surprisingly good handling\". http://www.roadandtrack.com\\n\\n\\nAnd most of its other reviews have said pretty much the same things about the car as stated above: good handling, nice styling, comfortable interior. Yeah, there are some bad reviews, but there are many many more good ones, and it doesnt\\'t get \"panned\" as you have continually been repeating.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s also not overlook the TOP GEAR 2002 Motoring Survey, in which \"over 37,000 motorists\" were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers. The rankings for the entry-level cars were:\\n\\n1.) Lexus IS 200\\n\\n2.) Jaguar X-TYPE\\n\\n3.) BMW 3-Series\\n\\n4.) Mercedes-Benz C-Class\\n\\n5.) Audi A4 and A4 Avant (wagon)\\n\\n6.) Saab 9-3\\n\\n7.) Volvo S40 and V40 (wagon)\\n\\n8.) Alfa Romeo 156\\n\\n\\nThey had little quotes by some of the cars. The X-TYPE\\'s read: \"Just past its first anniversary and the X-Type enters the survey three places ahead of the BMW 3-Series [out of the total 120 cars]. Great dealer service, few problems and good dynamics see to that.\"\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s not argue here though riez. We both have opinions, and I simply don\\'t agree with yours. Hostilities aside, have a great day! :-)\\n\\n__________________________________\\n\\n\\ndpvwia2-\\n\\n\\nThe whole Jaguar/Ford thing died a long time ago. X-TYPE shares 6 points on its platform with the Mondeo - not even its entire platform, and it shares no body panels with any other car. Anyone could just as easily say that your A4 is just a Jetta with four rings on its grille.\\n\\n_________________________________\\n\\n\\nPat-\\n\\n\\nSorry, I thought that you had already deleted the post as it had not appeared on my page until I clicked on \"scroll up\". I had just assumed that you had taken care of it when I didn\\'t see it load on the page I was at.', \"The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series.\\n\\nI think the Xtype still has a way to go as far as I go, before I ever would consider one to be a class leader.\\n\\nWhile you have a private debate going with riez - my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy, but the trades and mags of barometers.

It's a little higher than that $40K estimate of yours. My point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing, but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around $40,000, like any other car in its class, it carries a high price when totally fully loaded. This is my point about the X-TYPE in the 11 car R&T comparison: a nicely equipped one (similarly equipped with that $40,000 3 in the test) can be had for around $40,000, but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price. It wasn't quite fair. Totally fully loaded, the Mercedes-Benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin. Ever notice how the E-Class starts at around $50,000, but the S-TYPE and 5-Series start at around $42,000?\\n\\nAs far as class leaders go, I believe that all of the cars in this class are very good, and that they target slightly different groups. X-TYPE and C-Class have more luxury than the others, G35 and 3-Series are a little more performance oriented, but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits.\\n\\nIt's nice to hear from you!

And many of the European cars a Euro-spec X-type is compared against in these tests aren't even sold in America. Besides marques like Fiat, SEAT, Alfa, Lancia, etc. Heck I can't even spell the French marques that are no longer sold in USA: Renault and Peugueot. Been so long since since I've even seen an old French-marque car in my neighborhood.\\n\\nSo ensuring all the cars are USA-spec is critical to a legitimate comparison.\\n\\nAnd I've always loved the pro-Brit bias in the English car magazines. They do whatever they can to say nice things about English cars. I leaf thru their mags at my local Borders and Barnes & Noble. The German press has raved about the underlying Ford Mondeo platform. Mondeo built in Germany.\", 'I\\'ve been subscribing to AutoWeek for over 10 years and I don\\'t recall that issue. If you know what issue that is in due tell. I have hard time believe they did a specific testing of each of these cars structures to determine that. The A4 is the one I felt was the most solid. As far as that test goes, I think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the C320 may have.I don\\'t think a 1/2 second is stomping anything into the ground, and the Jag should have been faster considering it was a manual. Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn\\'t what the car focuses on primarily. I\\'d be more impressed with a \"pumeling\" by the X-Type of the 330i or IS300 in those areas.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong, I don\\'t think the X-Type is a bad car, but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it.\\n\\nM', \"I don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. I don't deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car. I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.\\n\\nPeople have different requirments for what they want in a car. We have to be careful between comparing the MSRP of fully optioned cars, because most people do not order them that way. The base 330i with leatherette can be had at ED for a mere $32,000.\\n\\nBTW..Nice to to talk to you as well.\", \"kshapiro... Can't believe you did not get Sport Package. That is almost heresy.\\n\\nDon't forget that BMW's current nav system stinks. Just now finally moving to DVD-based system instead of CD, but still most reviewers prefer systems used by other marques. (I think a Mark 1 eyeball and a good map beats a nav system about 99 percent of time. And the dash looks better without one, IMHO.)\", \"They were interested in moving the car....and I really like that car, so I decided to take it. We'll see what the landscape looks like the next time around.\", 'Merc1-\\n\\nGo to:\\n\\nhttp://autoweek.com/search/search_display.mv?port_code=autoweek&cat_code=reviews&content_code=09870788&Search_Type=STD&Search_ID=609952&record=2\\n\\nThey say, \"This particular parts-sharing, it turns out, only gives the Jag its chassis \\'hard points\\' and its engine blocks, but not much else. Jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blue-oval counterpart, and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet. In fact, they boast, by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car, its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor. By another measure, body stiffness comes in at 22 kg/degree vs. the 21 kg/degree recorded by the BMW 3 Series, a mighty fine measuring stick to use.\" <--See, they measured it.</b>\\n\\nOther reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class, I can find them and post their URLs if you\\'d like, if this review is not proof enough.\\n\\nAlso, if the link doesn\\'t work because the site is a sign-in type, go to autoweek.com and use their search box, typing in \"Jaguar X-type\".\\n\\nBTW: I do think that X-TYPE v. C-Class review was also a little \"BS\"-ed, however, I believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some BS, as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away. However...\\n\\nYou say \"Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn\\'t what the car focuses on primarily.\"\\n\\nIsn\\'t the C-Class supposed to compete with the IS300, 330i, and X-TYPE? Why is it that when the X-TYPE does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with \"they don\\'t focus on those areas\"? I\\'m willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the X-TYPE won out every other category of the test as well: Engine, brakes, ride... I could just as easily say that the X-TYPE doesn\\'t focus on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse. You also note that 1/2 second is not \"stomping anything to the ground\", yet in the Road&Track 11-car test, the X-TYPE was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that. We can\\'t suddenly make an exception for this test. I could say that the X-TYPE doesn\\'t focus on acceleration in the R&T review, but again that is a poor excuse. If we choose to accept the R&T 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well. In those regards, the X-TYPE v. C-Class comparison was quite valid.\\n\\nTake care!\\n__________________________________\\n\\nRiez-\\n\\nI think I\\'ll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say. It\\'s just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don\\'t stop. But...\\n\\nI noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car\\'s losing points, as well as R&T, C&D, and others noting that. I\\'m just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as I outlined how the X-TYPE in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the X-TYPE been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test. Also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps. Being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not \"falling flat\" by any means.\\n\\nYou seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores. Take note of the \"luggage space\" scores for the cars in the R&T 11 car test, for instance. The X-TYPE has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet. For that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category. Now look at the Cadillac CTS with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet. Yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot. The Infiniti G35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the X-TYPE, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10. The 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the X-TYPE with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i. These ratios aren\\'t right, and I cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.\\n\\nI also still disagree with you about European or other comparison tests not being valid. Included in these tests are cars such as the X-TYPE, C-Class, and A4, et al, that are sold in the U.S., as well as cars that are not available here. Just because a car is not U.S.-spec doesn\\'t mean the test is totally invalid. In those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go). It is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test. That\\'s where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out. Besides, the difference between a U.S.-spec car and a non-U.S.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the U.S., etc. You can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an American magazine is a bit ignorant. Especially as all of these cars are global cars.\\n\\nYou also claim that English reviews have a bias towards British cars and that the Germans also are biased. However, I have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any American reviewer would dare to. The British also have a thing for BMW\\'s - a German car - and I\\'ve not found a review where they had a bias for Jaguar or any other British car, and if they were biased and I missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any American editors.\\n\\nPerhaps you have not noticed the bias that American reviewers have for German and Japanese cars? I believe Edmunds stated something about their \"infatuation\" with \"everything German\" in a Mercedes review, and the idea that Japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of American writers (and don\\'t attempt to say that I\\'m saying that Japanese cars are not reliable now, because they are, I\\'m simply pointing out that there is an American bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car).', 'kdshapiro-\\n\\nYou said \"I don\\'t know what car you speced out but it\\'s not my car. I don\\'t deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car. I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it\\'s fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that\\'s your call.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s exactly what I was trying to prove about the X-TYPE in its tests. Take, for instance, the Road&Track 11 car comparo. The X-TYPE had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have. It has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) X-TYPE and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.\\n\\nYou are totally correct, NO ONE ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the X-TYPE in its comparison tests. They don\\'t for the other cars. Even that second-most-expensive-car in the test C320 Sport was still not fully loaded, it didn\\'t even have a CD player, as I mentioned before in my other message. In the magazines, they depict the X-TYPE as costing $46,000 all of the time. A base X-TYPE 2.5 with standard Connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000. Make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash CD player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000. Nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000. A nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.\\n\\nIn my other message, I wasn\\'t trying to talk about your car. I was using the 3-Series as an example of how in the tests they\\'ll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car\\'s fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the X-TYPE\\'s fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other cars.', 'Okay I missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category. Most people do not buy a car like that.', \"jagboyxtype... Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type. )\\n\\nAnd I'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to European magazine results when Euro-spec cars are sold here. But today I can NOT even buy them. Think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their American counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in Europe that are absent in America (Alfa, Fiat, Lancia, SEAT, Renault, Peugeout, Skoda, etc.)\", 'Riez-\\n\\nYou missed the target again. The trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe. The fact of the matter is that the X-TYPE had more boot space than the other cars I mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected. You also failed to notice the phrases \"For example\" and \"For instance\" leading into what I was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that I was speaking about.\\n\\nYou said of the X-TYPE\\'s large boot \"And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.\"\\n\\nFrom this I can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the X-TYPE does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such cars as the XJ8 and ES300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact. But what can I expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?\\n\\nAnd on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others. *FOR EXAMPLE* (<--if you miss it this time, I don\\'t know what to do), BMW uses General Motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with Mini. Volkswagen and Audi, Seat, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti all share many <i>many parts. DaimlerChrysler and Mercedes-Benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with Hyundai and Mitsubishi. Making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor. They share parts; yeah - so what? It\\'s not really relevant.\\n\\nAnd as I noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the cars do have some differences from U.S.-spec cars (as you and I had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as I had also said before in my other message. Quite often, those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the U.S., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us. If it\\'s a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a \"Diesel Showdown!\" or something else to that same effect. Again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in America. The cars we are disputing are not even built in America. And many times, the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their U.S.-spec versions. Alpha Romeos, Fiats, Renaults, and Vauxhalls are not sold in America, and thus I understand saying that for use in America, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but Audis, Jaguars, BMWs, and Mercedes are all sold in the U.S. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their U.S.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge. They never crash-test the cars in these comparisons, and as C. Van Tune pointed out in the ABC article about how reviewers are \"fed and fueled\" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn\\'t an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant. Safety equipment is usually the primary difference between U.S.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that\\'s not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things. Yet it\\'s not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though. You are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.\\n\\nAs well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, X-TYPE has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators. In comparison to a long-wheelbase Maybach, it is cramped, yes. However, it has one of the larger rear seats in its class. Not only is it larger than the BMW 3-Series\\' rear seat as well as the IS300\\'s and A4\\'s, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-Series\\' rear seat (but I\\'ll admit not by that much compared to the 5). In posts in other sections of the Town Hall, you defend how large the 5-Series\\' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the X-TYPE\\'s rear seat - which is even larger than the 5\\'s - \"cramped\". Is this yet ANOTHER ASSUMPTION that you made about the X-TYPE?\\n\\nBy now I am sure that you have noticed that I have continually refered to things in this message that I have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back. I\\'m wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you\\'re even making outright assumptions. No matter what I say and no matter how many facts I back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don\\'t even take them into account. Not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don\\'t even touch on facts or reality.\\n\\nAnd I\\'d say the best selling Jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of Jaguar\\'s U.S. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in Europe, as well as over 70% of Jaguar\\'s sales in its third largest market, Italy. Was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?\\n\\nMaybe we\\'ll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what\\'s actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks. Good day.', 'Ok, I read all that. So I\\'m supposed to believe Jaguar\\'s claim over what every other brand claims right? Until I see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity, I\\'ll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn\\'t the Jaguar X-Type. So we disagree there.\\nSecondly, everyone knows full well that the C-Class is not on the same plane with the 330i and IS300 when it comes to being \"sporty\". To impress me you\\'d have to beat those cars at all the track tests. Beating a C320 at the track isn\\'t hard, the IS300 and 330i rule there. That acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.\\n\\nI\\'m not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but I still maintain that they picked the areas in which the X-Type would winout. And Lastly the X-Type has been ranked below the C in every OTHER comparo done. If it were such a slaughter I\\'d think it would win some test over here too.\\n\\nM', 'jagboyxtype... You should have more carefully read my post. Did I specifically mention the X-type trunk (boot)? No, I was discussing trunks in general. And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans? Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors? When you get creamed on the track and street, talk about the trunk?\\n\\nI don\\'t care about sales figures. What do they prove? If we used that we\\'d all be driving a Camry or Accord 4-cyl sedan!\\n\\nAs for Euro-land market, keep in mind two huge facts. Currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels. The \"hottest\" BMW is the 330id. Can I buy that in USA? NO! And that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission. How many manual transmission diesel sedans, coupes, convertibles, etc. are sold in USA? Be willing to bet the figure is about zero. Ford Europe and Jag are rushing to get diesels into their Euro-products.', 'Riez-\\n\\nAgain my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data. Points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.\\n\\n\"And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?\"\\n\\nYes, I did catch that phrase the first time I read it. However, your argument against the X-TYPE in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false. And now your latest statement that you did not name the X-TYPE directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.\\n\\nYou stated: \"Maybe we\\'ll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn\\'t compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don\\'t buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type.\"\\n\\nYour argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedans because those are two areas in which the X-TYPE excels. If it had a small boot and a cramped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points! Then, to further attempt to deride the X-TYPE, you state that large boots, such as the X-TYPE has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes. Of course you did not have to \"name\" the X-TYPE when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, \"it\". Why even mention space-intruding hinges if the X-TYPE does not have them? Also, paragraphically, your topic was about the X-TYPE, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the X-TYPE. However, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the X-TYPE - a weak argument.\\n\\n\"I don\\'t care about sales figures. What do they prove?\"\\n\\nYou constantly say that the X-TYPE does not compete well against its competators. Sales figures and how much of the car\\'s manufacturer\\'s sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes. If the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer\\'s sales. The Camry and Accord 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class. However, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good cars. Also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of X-TYPE buyers are new customers to Jaguar. That means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.\\n\\nIf you have not gotten the fact that there are European comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as U.S.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree. I have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their U.S. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the U.S. and other such options are so much like their American versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two. If there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account. However, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.\\n\\n\"Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?\"\\n\\nNo, I \"harp\" on such little things because YOU bring them up by making FALSE assumptions which you present as if they were facts. Again, I used those \"little\" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth. YOU are the one who decided to \"harp\" on my examples.\\n\\nAlso, as I have stated and continue to have to remind you, the X-TYPE does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators. EXAMPLES: the X-TYPE completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from Mercedes-Benz, the C320 Sport. It is a competing car. Then, your so-very-important Road&Track even states: \"In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distance exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300\\'s and Audi A4\\'s 7.1, Mercedes-Benz C320\\'s 6.8 sec. and matching the BWM 330i\\'s time. And remember the X-TYPE, like the Quattro, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive\". According to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the Porsche 911 GT2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 GT2 from 60 mph. That is real performance and if you try to argue that down, I believe I could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.\\n\\nPerhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well. I\\'m having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you\\'ve made thus far.\\n\\nYou did get one thing right though. Jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the European market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer\\'s sales there. That was a weak point for the X-TYPE: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in Europe. Rest assured that when the engines are available, the X-TYPE will compete even better than it already does so well. And when I\\'m on the track, I\\'ll remember to mention my car\\'s boot to the Porsche that I out-brake and to the IS 300, A4, C320 that I out accelerate and the BMW driver that I\\'m dead-locked with. Even Road&Track took note of that.', \"Merc1-\\n\\nOther marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the X-TYPE has because they do not. You say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, I could just say that the X-TYPE feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over. Either way, we cannot do that. AutoWeek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and I even quoted them a little way back. They also noted that the X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's. That means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the X-TYPE, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%. You are just choosing not to accept a fact.\\n\\nAs for the X v. C article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the X-TYPE would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins? The same can be said about any comparison. Look at what is said in these articles, point-wise, the C-Class may win, however, in actual measurements, the X-TYPE beats it. Take for instance what Road&Track said about acceleration, which I quoted above in my message to riez.\\n\\nOh well, we don't agree on this one. At least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles, etc. Whether you choose to believe what is said is you choice. Have a nice day.\", 'THIRTY PERCENT more rigid????? ummmmmmm....\\n\\n-Chris', 'considering most manufacturers make improvements in rigidity on the scale of 50 to 100 percent, when they do a platform update, 30% sounds at least a little reasonable. Lets get pluskin in here, he should know, and if not, he should be able to find out. I would trust him more than any hear-say in this forum.', \"Betcha can't get a Jag, BMW or Audi with a thong holder! ;-)\", \"i haven't heard from pluskin in awhile...\\n\\nthey DOUBLE their rigidity with EVERY platform update... since it's you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there's a point where you can't go beyond?\\n\\n-Chris\", 'OMG...you guys actually read through all that...', 'How ironic the one car they couldn\\'t have known about yet was the A4, it came out after the Jag by a few months.

Car and Driver is most guilty of this. Agreed. Their last comparo was seemingly decided on how the 330i handled mountain roads, something most people don\\'t drive on.

In many reviews, the editors have stated that the X-TYPE\\'s structure is the class leader in measured rigidity, and as many reviews have concluded this, I accept the fact. If the measurements of the A4\\'s rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the X-TYPE\\'s, then I would accept that, however, at this moment, the X-TYPE is known as the most rigid car in its class.\\n\\nThis is not to say that the A4 has not surpassed the 3-Series in rigidity or possibly the X-TYPE, or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity; it is simply to say that with the information available, all current measurements have proven the X-TYPE to be the most rigid to this day.\\n\\n\"I always willing to read and listen hence our actual debating and not outright arguing.\"\\n\\nYes, thank you for being that way. It makes discussion so much more pleasant when two people can actually debate without losing total respect for each other and resorting to primitive argumentative states.

However, what I can judge with relative certainty are the crash test results for the X type, 3 series, C class and various other models which is related to structural stiffness and design. From these results\\n\\nhttp://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/summary_midlux.htm\\n\\nand\\n\\nhttp://euroncap.com/ratings.php3?id=large_family_cars&order=1\\n\\nI am pretty certain that the C class has the best designed structure in it's class with the Jag being behind the 3 series and the A4. The C class was one of only 2 cars in the EuroNCAP test to get a full 5 star rating and the C class is the highest rated midsize luxury car according the Insurance Institute. The intrusion and deformation ratings are as follows...\\n\\nhttp://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/grey_midlux.htm\\n\\nAnyway, if I had a choice on any of these cars, I'd save up my money and get an E class, but that's my personal opinion...\", 'Actually, stiffness mainly determines how much a cars twists during quick handling maneuvers.\\nWhereas, occupant protection arises from engineering to divert kinetic energy from the crash into crumple zones and away from the main passenger cabin. The challenge is actually to get the stiff but crushable compromise correct.\\n\\nSo stiffness equals good handling more than occupant protection.', 'Actually, this isn\\'t the X-TYPE we have here in the U.S.\\n\\nThis is the X-TYPE section of the car crash test above:\\n\\n\\nhttp://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002\\n\\n\\nTake note that this is the \"Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD\" marked under the \"Make, model and hand of drive\" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page. The X-TYPE 2.0 is the low-end Europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3-Series and C-Class). Thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and 3-Series and C-Class, because 2.0 is a FWD car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in AWD (X-TYPE) and RWD (C-Class, 3-Series) cars.\\n\\n\\nCheck out this site:\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htm\\n\\n\\nIt notes that the X-TYPE underwent structural changes after December 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which I discovered it was). A letter to Consumer Reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:\\n\\n\\n\"We spoke with JNA (Jaguar North America) on this question and they explained that the Jaguar X-Type was originally introduced in Europe as a 2.0 litre FWD (Front Wheel Drive) model. The only models sold in the U.S. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter AWD versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the FWD European model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. The prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the AWD traction... The modifications made and referred to in IIHS\\'s report on X-Types (made) after December 2001 were actually modifications made to FWD European models and are not applicable to the U.S. AWD models.\"\\n\\n(Thanks \"JagDude\" and Consumer Reports for this information).\\n\\n\\nAlso note that the reason why the C-Class recieved a 5-star rating in the European test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of \"fasten your seatbelt\" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in Europe in the future(?). It would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light. This is straight off the site:\\n\\n\\n\"Extra points awarded for the way that the C-class reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. Results for the C-class were published last year and it achieved four stars. But Euro NCAP has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.\"\\n\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'d feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class, and I do feel safe being in one of them. Stay safe everyone.', 'I honestly cannot remember a car I\\'ve been in that HASN\\'T had a seatbelt warning light. Our 87 Mercedes 420 SEL had it and my 99 Honda Prelude has it. Maybe this is due to European influence as the Focus (originally introduced and designed in Europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars I\\'ve been in have \"sensed\" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (I believe the LandCruiser does this). However, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the US, maybe this is a good idea after all. I can personally attest my safety and my mother\\'s life to seatbelts.\\n\\nBTW JagBoy, the EuroNCAP X-Type was a 2002 and it stated that the FWD 2.0 was released March of that year which is supported by both CAR and Top Gear Magazines (British publications). In addition, I am relatively certain that the X-Type was introduced as an AWD model to differentiate it from the Mondeo and to keep it from alienating Jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a FWD Jag (this is from a CAR article soon before the X-Type itself was introduced in May of 2001). However, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a C180 or 318i in terms of value, Jag decided to introduce the FWD 2.0 with a stick as standard.\\n\\nFrom what I understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it\\'s fewer driveline components (obviously as it is FWD) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple. I believe this is the reason why Mercedes decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the E class with the smaller block of the 3.2 V6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although I\\'m not sure if Mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch.', '\"they DOUBLE their rigidity with EVERY platform update... since it\\'s you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there\\'s a point where you can\\'t go beyond?\"\\n\\nWell...yes theoretically speaking, there is a point where you cant go beyond...but nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity.\\n\\nWe are talking about a large structure, on the scale of 100s of centimeters, which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds, and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering. Not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity.\\n\\nThere is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles. Even full out race cars have problems from structural rigidity...I believe the initial Audi R8 had multiple problems with body flex...parts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines.\\n\\nSo, yes, there is tons of room for improvement in all cars in the area of rigidity.', 'Yes, my X-TYPE also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. Most all cars do. In addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. A small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger\\'s side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.\\n\\nThe warning system in the Mercedes C-Class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here. Notice that the C-Class had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said \"put on your seatbelt\", the car\\'s score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say \"put on your seatbelt\" to be used in other cars. I\\'m not saying that the C does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. It is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so I do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.\\n\\n\\nYou are also wrong about the 3.0 Jaguar engine \"pushing\" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. Also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the X-TYPE is designed to \"drop\" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. Most modern cars do this. X-TYPE\\'s engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. Again, however, the X-TYPE drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. The argument that a 2.0 FWD X-TYPE would be safer than an AWD larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.\\n\\n\\nYou really should read the bottom chart of the EuroNCAP page for the X-TYPE:\\n\\n\\nhttp://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002\\n\\n\\nIt specifically states that the car is: \"Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD. Only the FWD X-TYPE is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. All other X-TYPEs are built in AWD configuration. The AWD driveshaft of the AWD X-TYPEs aid in collisions v. the FWD version that is sold alongside them in Europe against 318 and C180.\\n\\n\\nMercedes-Benz decided to changed to a V6 from an I6 because they lowered the bonnet of the E-Class between those configurations and could not fit the I-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. That is also the reason for the discontinuation of the E300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the V6 was introduced (that and because the E300 did not sell well here). The E-Class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. I\\'ve not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision.', 'While the C-Class did gain an extra star because NCAP changed it\\'s guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the C class did earn it\\'s full 5 stars as it\\'s a very well designed car collision-wise, when I can find the article in which NCAP justified giving the C class an extra star b/c of it\\'s overall performance, I\\'ll paste the link. As the pre 2003 E Class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it\\'s previous 4 when it doesn\\'t.\\n\\nThe fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn\\'t as obvious is while the X-Type is designed to, as you describe, drop it\\'s engine and driveline components, they will always \"push\" into the compartment as evidenced by the Insurance Institute\\'s listing of the crash details in which the X-Type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. The best rated C Class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. Engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. While I don\\'t doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, I wasn\\'t trying to prove one way or another, I was speculating on a possible alternative.\\n\\nAnd while I may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, I am certain that the E class\\' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine\\'s newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. This is evidenced by the 99 E320 having the V6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. The discontinuation of the E300 in the U.Ss WAS caused by the low demand for that particular car AND b/c of the structural change. However, that never meant that Mercedes dropped diesels from it\\'s complete linup, in fact, Europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel E class engines which Mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 E Class.', 'Speaking of Mercedes and safety.

The cabin was in perfect shape basically. The other was I believe a 600SEL. This one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. The guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass.\\n\\nThe third accident was an E320 which was involved in a head on collision with a Camaro, who was racing another Camaro on a 2 lane road.

The car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started.\\n\\nIm generally dont praise late model Mercedes\\', but I will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. In my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo.

I understand the whole \"they\\'re in BMW\\'s payroll\" thing as well as the \"but we\\'re not\" thing. This month\\'s letters to the editors & Edmunds\\' responses make good points on both sides.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. I\\'m specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a TL-S edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. The idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put BMW above the Acura.\\n\\nIs this happening? Well, I decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. Given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. What, Acura got slower or BMW got faster? Given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 BMW front seat comfort is tops while Acura\\'s is bottom. Did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?\\n\\nNot that only Acura gets the shaft either. In 2001 BMW got a higher \"feature content\" rating than the TL-S. In 2002, a 330i with MORE features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a TL-S with the same features. This in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash CD changer) were simply left off the Top 10 features list in 2002, leaving BMW as a vehicle that offers every Top 10 feature as either standard or optional.\\n\\nBasically, I like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. When I look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?\\n\\nIn one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. I suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.\\n\\nUntil then, I\\'m going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. We spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. If you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you\\'d think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.\\n\\nFront seat comfort\\n2001: Acura 83, BMW 83\\n2002: BMW 9.2, Acura 7.6\\n\\nRear seat comfort\\n2001: BMW 74 Acura 70\\n2002: Acura 9.2 BMW 5.8\\n\\nConclusion: either BMW and Acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results.', 'I was noticing how the hood ornament was still standing. :-) Anyhow, all I can say is that Mercedes still rule in crashes.\\n\\nAbout seat comfort, my theory is seats are mass produce by suppliers and sometimes maybe precision of making the seats can run off track.

Then again even after paying many extra $$$ for the performance package..the 330i is still down 35hp to the TL. I used to road race motorcycles and if I only had a buck for every time I passed people in a corner only to watch them go flying past on the straight because they had more hp.

I have not bought any nav systems in my cars to this point (I find a $20 map/atlas that I can carry from car to car is a pretty unbeatable value) so I don\\'t know this for sure, but my understanding is that the nav system on the TL allows you to say \"Phone Home\" and then the car will dial the number for you, whereas this is not possible on the nav-equipped Accord.\\n\\nNow this may seem silly to you but I kind of dig this feature a lot for 3 reasons:\\n\\n1) I never use a cell phone when driving (unless I\\'m stuck in traffic and need to tell someone I\\'ll be late) because it\\'s dangerous so to be able to make voice-activated calls is incredibly useful.

Also, if you must talk on the phone, this is a much safer way to do it and could save your life, which is definitely worth something.\\n\\n2) One of my favorite shows as a kid was Knight Rider (in spite of David Hasselhoff) because the talking corvette with the roving Cylon eye was just so cool.

Both cars are within a hair of each other in HP, TQ, 0-60 and 1/4 mile acceleration, skidpad grip, slalom speed, and braking distances.\\n\\nEven the weight distribution is close (54/46 vs. 59/41).\\n\\nYes, dynamically FWD and RWD perform differently. From a standing start, the IS300 has an advantage over the Mazda 6 because it has better traction to the drive wheels. On a racetrack however, that advantage is gone, as it simply requires a different driving technique (line) to make a FWD go fast vs. a RWD.\\n\\nBasically, going around a road course quickly involves three elements - power-to-weight ratio, braking performance, and traction. In corners, traction is key because the more you have, the more power you can put down on the pavement. The factor that most affects traction is weight transfer, which is why smoothness is so important for fast lap times.\\n\\nCompared to a FWD car, in a RWD car, turn-in happens sooner because during braking (entry), weight shifts away from the drive wheels, and the resulting loss of traction can cause oversteer. Since turn-in is earlier, the apex also comes sooner, causing the line to straighten and allow the driver to begin accelerating. This technique obviously won\\'t work well in a FWD car because the \"wrong wheels\" need the traction to exit the corner. Therefore, weight transfer through a corner must be managed differently for a FWD car.\\n\\nIf you\\'re piloting a FWD car into a corner, you adjust your line by braking and turning-in later. This adjusts the line by moving the apex out farther. With a later apex, the FWD\\'er straightens the line through the turn and can accelerate harder, sooner.\\n\\nIt may not seem as natural to you, but it is no less effective at producing fast lap times.\\n\\nAs far as torque steer is concerned - no it\\'s not fun, but modern high performance FWD cars (like the Mazda 6 or Acura TL) have it managed very well, so if it\\'s present at all, it\\'s more of a distraction than a performance handcap.\\n\\nOf course, all of this talk is moot on the street.

I do admit that 270 HP is a lot to send to the front wheels...\\n\\nThat said, while I don't believe FWD takes away from the fun to be had driving the TL, I do suspect that its 3700# curb weight makes it more of a Grand Tourer than a canyon carver.\\n\\nI would take a TSX over the TL any day...and in fact, I did!\", \"ACura rocks in many ways - the TL is a sweet ride but it is not a sports sedan at 85-95% of the envelope - while it may perform in curves nearly as well - hell even as well - better? possibly with ASPEC, it won't feel as competently done.\\n\\n That late turn in the FWD offers is kinda neat and I enjoyed it in the acura's I've owned and driven but the rumbling torque steer over bumps or uneven pavement is a very unimpressive offering for you and your passengers in a heavy car even.\\n\\nThe tsx may be the best value for that market segment ever. It's very much like the TL in terms of appearance and stance...TSX owners must love it! And not vice versa\", 'fedlawman... Please review the earlier recent posts. As I said, I am NOT talking smooth test track performance. Heck, using that criteria a FWDer with a live rear axle can be quite the performer. I\\'m talking on the real roads I drive every day. On the twisties. On the curves. On the bumps. (You really appreciate IRS when you are taking a nice sweeper fast and you hit a bump. When you lack IRS the entire rear bounces up in the air and you say a silent prayer. Not unlike torque steer!)\\n\\nToday I had fun \"playing\" with my business FWD Sonata (V6, 5-speed manual with defeatable traction control) in the snow and ice. She tugs and pulls like crazy every time she loses traction. All that weight over the front wheels and those drive wheels trying to steer at the same time they fight for traction. You fight to steer her. Just take a corner as you lose some front wheel traction. Pulls left then right. Laws of physics. That is true for every FWDer I\\'ve ever driven hard. (And, yeah, I had fun driving \\'01 TL Type S but she torque steered. Same for the I35 Sport I drove.) Only way to go is to ensure the drive wheels are not the steering wheels!\\n\\nDon\\'t forget that 5% of 3,000 pounds is 150 pounds. FWDer is like having your pre-teen sitting on your hood all the time.', \"FWD vs RWD has been debated to death. My personal take is that the difference is overrated.\\n\\nMB makes RWD vehicles but how well do they handle? Every MB I've ever driven has been a nice car but handling wasn not really its strongest characteristic.\\n\\nLexus makes both FWD and RWD cars, but aside from Riez's favorite IS300 (LOL, he has 2 of 'em), I would really have to focus very hard to tell the difference in the drivetrain. A soft plushy ride completely divorced from any feel for the road sucks whether the drivetrain is a FWD or RWD.\\n\\nIf you really want to make a performance car, you not only have to have the RWD but you need to do all the other things it takes to get the weight balance as close to 50-50. Not sure what the exact weight balance on the IS300 is Riez, but it doesn't sound anywhere close to 50-50, so on that basis Infiniti G35 and BMW are going to be a lot better than IS300.\\n\\nAlso, I think if you are used to a RWD and then go to a FWD, the difference is really noticeable so you tend to overemphasize it. The opposite is also true.\\n\\nFor example, I'm now used to my MDX and when I had to drive an ML320, it took me a while to get used to the turns. Once I got used to it in 5 mins. it was fine.\\n\\nI find that as long as I have some feel for the road, I can get used to just about any car and drive with my normal skill level, and after a while don't notice it unless I try to go above 7/10ths.\\n\\nLiving in the NE, I prefer FWD b/c I can slap on all seasons and not worry about snow tires. Yes, you can get a RWD/AWD sedan, but those are a lot heavier, so their performance is compromised and they eat up a lot more gas.\\n\\nWhen I move to CA, where bad weather isn't as much of a problem, I'd give a lot more consideration to RWD, but I'm not going to let the drivetrain alone influence my decision as to which car I want.\", \"saugatak...

I have a TL and I really in to cars so I have driven quiet a few RWD and FWD cars. With that said do you really know your cars limits, I bet you don't, because if you do you must of crash it a few times (or be really close to it) to understand were exactly the limit is.

I don't think any of you two had this kind of experience and for this meter so as anybody else on this side including myself. So if you think that RWD is better than FWD that is your opinion, not a fact, and it varies from car to car.

Acceleration is about torque, and not just peak torque, but the whole area under the torque curve. The TL achieves 238 lb.ft. @ 5000 rpm while the BMW achieves 214 lb.ft. @ 3500 rpm. So there is only 24 lb. ft. of difference in the peak torque, but the bmw acheives it much earlier. An earlier torque peak generally means a much broader and flatter torque curve in general (less peaky). It also generally means less peak hp, which explains the large hp difference.\\n\\nAnd second of all, the engine is not alone, power is tramsitted to the ground via the gearing of the transmission and the final drive axle. Gear spacing affects acceleration by allowing the engine to stay longer between its peak torque and peak hp. The first gear ratio also needs to be selected so as to deliver maximum power without overpowering the wheels and tires that will deliver the force to the ground.\\n\\nAll that being said, I listed the BMW, G35, and TL because they are approximately equal in all the acceleration testing I have seen.

The differences are in 1/10's of a second. Having gearing that emphasizes torque or speed in 3rd versus 2nd or 4th doesn't matter if you are measuring 0-60 or 0-100 since elapsed time is what is being measured.\\nGearing is more important on a race track since the car has to be set up to maximize speed within the confines of the circuit. Having a 160 mph top speed doesn't get you much if the straight only allows 140 mph top end.\\nI know the G35 is a great car. I would have bought the coupe but my wife couldn't live with two doors.

What a great world we live in if you\\'ve got 30-40k to spend on a car, huh? BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Acura, Caddy...whatever, things just keep getting better, huh?\\n\\nI just traded my 99 328i (E46) for a G35x. I absolutely loved the 328i, but the ABS pump went and I figured the $2500 repair price was a good excuse to go shopping. Before that, the car was rock-solid. Never a problem, really.\\n\\nThe G35x was just the best value for me out there. It\\'s beautiful (IMHO, of course), has AWD, and a GREAT engine (with more power, but not as smooth-revving as my BMW), while also giving me more room than my BMW. Oh, and it was about $6k less than the comparable 3-series today (330ix), although I don\\'t think the $6k is all prestige - there\\'s definitely something special about a 3.\\n\\nI test-drove the Acura TL and it\\'s a pretty amazing bargain. Didn\\'t care for the FWD feel or the dealers in my area or I\\'d probably be driving one today. Interior is AMAZING. Puts Infiniti and BMW to shame. During my test drives, for what it\\'s worth, the engine didn\\'t feel as good as the G35\\'s, but a test drive isn\\'t a great place to evaluate such things. Cars need about several thousand miles on them before the engines loosen up.\\n\\nAnyway, the BMW (with sport and summer tires)felt lighter and more agile than my new G35x, but the G35x feels more powerful and rides better. Both are awesome cars.\\n\\nOne other note about all of the posted \"tests\" from magazines. I love reading about cars, but the comparos really are sometimes apples to oranges. For example, BMWs are always tested with the sport package and summer tires (usually Pilots). Most other cars are tested with all-season tires. Mention is rarely made of that difference. It certainly must account for some of the skidpad and steering response results. In BMW\\'s defense, they have the guts to put top-flite performance tires on their cars so they should get credit...not like the crap Turanza EL42s that came on my G35x.\\n\\nAnyhow, my overall point is that after having owned a BMW 3 for over five years and extensively test driving an Audi A4, Acura TL, and G35x, I can say that I honestly think I could have been incredibly happy with any of these four cars. If Caddy can get their build-quality up I\\'m sure they will be another player. For those who don\\'t think there\\'s something special about a 3-series BMW, you really need to own one for a while. I fell in love and might very well find myself back in a BMW down the line. The g35x is a different and amazing car, though, and for me, it\\'s the best of what\\'s out there today.\\n\\nHeck, even if you\\'re looking in the 25k range you have the Passat, Mazda6, Accord, Altima, and Camry!\\n\\nWhatever you choose in whichever class, what a GREAT time to be car shopping!!!', '\" I\\'m sure it was an auto and I\\'m sure the poor guy just pressed on the gas real hard and his skills didn\\'t get in the way too bad.

You guys may find value in many things about many cars - I find value in the thrust and handling that no other car can best in class. \"\\n\\nNo problem with the latter part of this, about the G35, but the 540i surely isn\\'t in the G\\'s class, it\\'s several classes above it, and in the hands of a skilled driver the G35 doesn\\'t have a prayer with a 540i.\\n\\nIt really doesn\\'t say much for the G to be compared to the Porsche 928, especially since the car was designed in the seventies. There used to be a website called http://www.4car.co.uk/ and they had all kinds of comparos such as the one you\\'ve made here. Before their demise they had a test in which the Audi S6 (Euro model only), XJR (pre 04) and M5 were competing with a used to be untouchable Ferrari, the 512TR, which started out as the Testarossa in the 1980\\'s, and guess what...the M5 beat the Ferrari in every measure. Point being that cars simply advance. I don\\'t know what a 350Z would do other than get humiliated by a 911 GT3.

Taking the best of each number. Just to note, CR got 6.7 to 60 not 5.7.', 'Well, engineering can overcome certain aspects of FWD (torque steer elimination by careful axle length design, wheel spin out of corners with an LSD) but no engineering can overcome the laws of physics.\\n\\nI think we\\'re all familiar with a tire\\'s contact patch. All forces work through it. When you expect the front two tires to deal with lateral forces of turning AND acceleration/decceleration, the tire becomes overburdened more quickly than with RWD where the fronts just have to roll along and steer.\\n\\nThis type of performance handicap doesn\\'t show up in most performance tests. Acceleration numbers are all straight-line. Skidpad g\\'s are maximized under light throttle adjustments, so it doesn\\'t show up too much there. In slalom, a car\\'s \"normal\" transient behavior is explored and how quickly it can shift back and forth, but the driver is hardly turning left and right in a way that fully collapses the suspension. More importantly though, just like the skidpad tests, the slalom is done with just enough throttle to maintain a smoothe constant speed.\\n\\nIf you want to see where RWD reigns superior over FWD, look at track lapping times. This is where the driver must brake hard, turn in, and blast through and out of the corner. The RWD will be able to get on the gas earlier and harder and gain tenths through the corners. This mimics aggressive street driving more closely than any skidpad/slalom.\\n\\nBrian', \"look at track lapping times\\n\\nYes, do that.\\n\\nlook back through the discussion.

As with Audi, Volvo believes the answer is [AWD].\"\\n\\nVery powerful FWDers can reduce, but not completely eliminate, torque steer.', 'You\\'re right, I shouldn\\'t have engineering can \"overcome\" torque steer, but rather something along the lines of \"reduce\".\\n\\nAs far as the lapping times are concerned, I don\\'t have much data here at work with me, I will have to take a look at home. I would be willing to bet that the Integra you cite did not have the same power to weight ratio as those RWD cars. My point was -all else being equal- a RWD chassis will be faster around a track.\\n\\nWhen super-car builders (Ferrari, Ford GT, Lambo) set out to build an exotic high end sports car, they do so with very little concern for cost. If FWD was inherently equal to or better than RWD, why wouldn\\'t one of them have tried it already? Is Honda on to some sort of voo-doo front wheel drive that nobody else knows about?\\n\\nAnd reading over C&D\\'s comparo, it sounds like Acura still has a ways to go till they have the TL handling at its full potential.

I would have loved to have one but could not afford the extra money for the 330 (went with a CL-S) and the 325 was just too slow for me. Sadly i think BMW sells so much because so many people buy them for status and the more they raise the price the more people seem to want them.', 'There are plenty of differences between the 325i and the 330 beyond just the engine. For starters how about the transmission (yes, it is different), suspension, brakes, wheels and tires, power memory seat (left side), power seat (right side), upgraded audio system and of course the ever important trip computer.\\n\\nRegarding the \"same poor BMW reliability\", ummm, yeah right. Hate to burst your bubble, however, all scientific and anecdotal evidence suggests that the Audi line is considerably worse. Contrast that with my personal experience of over five years of BMW driving and so far, I have had two burned out taillights. Now, I realize that the Lexus crowd would be aghast at how unreliable my cars have been, but personally, I can live with that. ;-)\\n\\nAs for what\\'s a rip off, and what&#146;s an insults one\\'s intelligence, well, one could say that the only car that wasn\\'t an insult would be a completely utilitarian car which will get one from point A to point B and nothing more.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', \"95gt\\n\\nI got a loaded A4 1.8T frontrack for just under $30K.

For the last time, unless they're buying the car for me why the hell should I care what their opinion is?

Oh and different suspension and different wheels and different differential. Different chip programming. Lets toss in wholly different exhaust system and headers/cams. Oh and my speed is limited to 155 (which I hope one day to try out on a track) rather than 123 (I believe that's the ceiling for the 3 series normally) and my redline is 6800 which is higher than a 325i.\\n\\nIn addition to the performance upgrades from the 325i to the 330i ZHP, I also got a few luxury features I've grown to love...memory seats, tilt mirror. Useless fluff to some but the difference between me happily leaving my car for a wash and being annoyed I have to adjust everything back.\\n\\nAnd unless you are a stoplight racer for a living the 0-60mph difference is inconcequential.\\n\\nI don't know where you live but in So Cal we have annoying freeway lights. 100-200 feet to go from zero to 75.\\n\\nAm I a stop light racer? No. Do i consistently shift my in the upper region where the engine sings. Redline shifts are common for me on every drive. I bought a performance sedan and I make it perform. I often cruise in 3rd of 4th at around 80 mph so that when the need arises I can punch it and take off. This cannot be done with a 325i. Ask my bro-in-law as he and his 325i simply cannot keep up with my bone stock car.\\n\\nThe 325i has enough power to move that car very well. I personally, think they are both a ripoff, and that's why I went with an A4...but the 330 is by far the biggest insult to one's intelligence.\\n\\nTo each his own. The A4 doesn't offer the handling (especially a FWD one) or power I want when spending over 30k for a car. There's no reason I should EVER have to worry about merging or will I have enough power to shoot a gap if I'm in a near luxury sport sedan. With the A4 (I had a 1.8T) the engine pulls pretty well but not with the ferocious authority I'd expect paying over 30k. Go Quattro and an already slow car is now saddled by an inefficient drivetrain that saps power like crazy. Add the tiptronic and the car's dead in the water.\\n\\nWe all have priorities. Mine were performance, luxury and fun for a price I found reasonable. As the 325i only offered good handling it didn't meet my performance to price ratio. I'd gladly blow 40k again on my sedan as it's a grin producer. The 325i wasn't that big of a step up from my old Jetta. I couldn't rationalize spending 30-32k for a 325i that would leave me constantly annoyed at the lack of punch.\", \"As for what's a rip off, and what&#146;s an insults one's intelligence, well, one could say that the only car that wasn't an insult would be a completely utilitarian car which will get one from point A to point B and nothing more.\\n\\nExactly. We don't need the 200 HP engines and tight suspensions. We want them. Our cars regardless of marketing hype are totally luxury items.\", \"What you posted was:\\n\\nSo far you've said nothing to justify the $7,100 difference between the 325i and 330. The difference is 40 horses.\\n\\nWhich means that my response was accurate, if you add back in as much as possible to bring the 325i up to the level of the 330i, you need to add:\\n\\nSport Package: $1,400\\nHarman-Kardon Audio System: $675\\nOn-Board Comuter: $300\\nFront Dual Power Seats: $995\\nTotal: $2,470\\n\\nThat makes the price difference (still not quite apples to apples) only $4,630. That still leaves you with a car with smaller brakes, smaller engine, and a 5-Speed transmission instead of the 6-Speed on the 330i.\\n\\nIs $4,630 too much for all of that? For me, it's worth it, for someone else it's not. Is it a rip-off? I don't think so.\\n\\nRegarding the reliability, like virtually every manufacturer in the world, the reliability has improved dramatically in recent years, and statistically speaking, the E39 and E46 cars have improved to such an extent that they are among the best.

I know many women have asked what model my BMW is as they like it. Maybe a standard 3 wouldn't get so many comments. Shrug. I know in all the years I had a Jetta or a Stanza nobody ever walked up to me and started talking about my car. Or weirder still asked to sit in it. This isn't a freaking Lambo...\\n\\nMy friends used to call my gray Stanza the undercover car as it could move about unnoticed. The Jetta too felt that way. In my Protege I'm as anonymous as a speck of sand on the beach. In fact this morning I passed a friend of over 12 years on the freeway and waved and got nothing. I called her cell seconds laster and she said she didn't see my car anywhere. Which car? The BMW.\", 'The m3 and zhp pakages look pretty tuff - they do look very different to me than a 325 for sure.\\n\\nThe only attention I used to get in a 328 in south florida was the bird - I go for 6 months without even getting honked at but in sunny FLA the guys sitting on back of work trucks with nothing to do on thier way to job site flick cigarettes on the car or simply scream and flip you off - this happened weekly.

It's amazing where all this money is coming from. The next hot car is the G35, I see a dozen of those cars each way. I am starting to see a few more of the new TL's. I have noticed 2 or 3 new ones traveling in every morning. One thing is very interesting, I noticed that the G35 drivers are fairly courteous, never competitive. When I ride in the Aero Wagon and an Audi or BMW pull up, sometimes I get competitive power on.

My sister and I own both the \\'03 Max SE and \\'03 TL-S. The TL-S has slight advantages in handling, smoother ride, smoother engine at high RPM, and possibly exterior look. I like the Max interior ergonomics, quieter engine, smoother trans/engine interactions (both cars have slush box), and bigger size.\\n\\nTo most people, both cars are about equal overall, except for $2,000-$4,000 differences in prices, w/incentives on the Max.\\n\\nNow I haven\\'t test-driven the \\'04 TL yet, but I assume that the new smaller size and slightly more powerful engine would increase its performance/handling potentials even further. I tested the \\'04 Max the first day it arrived in the dealer and noticed that while the engine was even smoother/quieter than the \\'03 and the drive had been improved with the new rear ind. suspension set-up, the car\\'s bigger size reduced the handling part to just marginally better than the \\'03. And don\\'t even get me started with the new interior.......what the heck were they thinking?!?!\\n\\nWhen the new \\'06 BMW 3series come out in late \\'05, I\\'ll probably trade in the Max for the \"older\" version \\'05 3\\'s. Personally I think the current 3series has the best overall exterior look (especially in titanium silver) and the size is just about right for me--yes, I\\'ve grown tired of the bigger Max.

Good to know I'm not nuts for hating this thing.\\n\\nI strongly suggest checking out the '04 TL. I did try the previous gen TLs and, while I liked it, I found it rather boring.

The TSX is an Euro Accord, and the TL ( I see the old Civic tailights on this car) is just a larger version of it. What I liked about the G35 is that no current Nissan car looks remotely like it.

On paper, looks like I can have 330 power for less than 325 price, at a higher level of equipment (cd changer, leather, and still less than the 325).

G35 sedan looks light, where Max is just too heavy handed.\\n\\nWhen previous TL came out as a concept, I was very impressed by its look. A relative of mine was looking for a car. I recommended the car to him, he bought the car before it came out as production.

To me it seems that while Acura has moved the new TL closer to the BMW 3series, Nissan did just the opposite with the new Max.\\n\\nFor someone who's looking for a family sedan with room and power to spare, the Max is an excellent choice. However, for a single guy like me who likes corners and twisties, a more agile and smaller sedan would be more preferable.\\n\\nWhen it's time for my trade-up, the only cars I have in mind are the new TL , the G35/G35X, possibly the up-coming 250Hp AWD Subaru (for the AWD factor), and the 3series as the most favorite. I like almost everything about the car, except reliability.....sorry, didn't mean to sound like a broken record :-)\", \"What I like about the G35 is the overall shape... numero uno in judging appearance IMO. It has a fluid airfoil shape, similar to the 911. Also, none of the details and proportions scream for attention. I think they could have done a better job with the headlights and grille though. Headlights say Maxima, grille says Cadillac.\\n\\nTL has subtle details but is too wedgy and chunky in the rear. Accordingly the shape is a bit unbalanced. And that swathe running just beneath the beltline looks like an afterthought... incongruous. I'd bet they added that near the deadline after thinking the car looked too vertical... to give the impression of less height. The wedge works better with smaller cars like TSX and RSX.

But when it comes out into real available light, the butt is very large.

As usual, the Temple of VTEC will be in attendance, delivering full coverage. Just recently we\\'ve heard some information from several diverse sources and the info seems to be fairly solid. Some of the stuff has already been \"confirmed\" (by logical interpretation of public statements), but some of it is new. In the first category is the drivetrain - we can say with virtually 100% certainty that it will be a V6 with AWD. The AWD system will almost certainly be based upon the Pilot/MDX\\'s VTM system. One source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear. Current horsepower estimates peg the car at around 300hp. We\\'ve heard a number of figures on displacement ranging from 3.4 to 3.8L, but our best guess is that it will use a 3.5L variant of the TL\\'s motor. IMA does not seem to be a part of the equation at the time of launch. Other interesting tidbits: the RL will feature fairly extensive use of aluminum body panels: roof, hood, and trunklid. The car will also continue to build upon Acura\\'s renewed emphasis on performance. The car is said to perform as well or better than the hot \\'04 TL (recall the TL 6MT\\'s very impressive skidpad and slalom figures). Based upon our sources, it seems the car will be positioned lower than where earlier rumors had it pegged (those rumors indicated it would be a true 7-series, S-class or Lexus LS competitor). While the TL is positioned against the 5-series (yet priced like a 3-series), the RL will very likely fall somewhere in between the 5-series and 7-series in size. Pricing will probably not deviate too far from the current RL\\'s pricing, and the content level will build upon the TL\\'s segment-blasting features. We\\'ve heard a few reports that luxury items such as power adjusted rear seats will appear on the RL. It\\'s our understanding that the car\\'s audio system was not developed with ELS. I will personally be surprised if it surpasses the TL\\'s superb ELS system. As in past Legend/RL models, the car\\'s development was carried out almost entirely in Japan and it will be built there as well.', \"One source (in our own forums) goes a step further and reports that the standard torque biasing will be 70/30 front to rear.

Maybe you need to ask yourself what qualifies you to call anyone a fool based on your opinion of what constitutes a performance sedan. This board is full of posts with statistics on performance and handling of FWD, RWD and AWD and in the end there is very little actual difference in the objective facts. Most of the differences are opinions held by individuals who seem to lack respect for someone elses opinion.

With that safety element now gone, there\\'s no reason for Acura to retard the car\\'s performance with the majority of the power running through the front wheels by default.\\n\\nAWD would allow Acura to finally move away from that which keeps many buyers at bay. You seem enamored with sales numbers so maybe this would appeal to you: if Acura offers a performance sedan that finally drives like a performance sedan while also offering a drive system that meets the \"safety\" needs of the FWD buyers, Acura could increase sales. Suddenly, two camps now see value where before only one group of buyers would.\\n\\nI have nothing against FWD buyers. I do have a problem with a manufacturer finally taking a step toward making a performance sedan by switching to AWD but then curtailing the vehicle\\'s performance by keeping power going through the steering wheels.\\n\\nAWD properly set up on a TL would get my business and probably that of many others. FWD on the TL will not. They could have 500 HP coming out of that car and it could cut through the slalom at 90 mph.

They do however point out whether a company is making money at what they are doing, assuming their cost elements are being met. They also show whether consumers are buying their product. From Acura's perspective, they have always built FWD cars and they have always been able to sell them. The fact that TL sales are up 57% lets Acura know they don't have to make any major changes to their manufacturing facilities by switching to RWD or AWD. Assuming their market share will increase by switching to another drivetrain is a risk they may not be willing to assume since they are already increasing sales. It will always be about making money for the major manufacturers.\\nSales usually dictate changes. The RL has fallen way behind in the luxury class because it has not kept pace with the competition. The consumer has dictated that Acura make changes or get out of that market segment. Acura engineers have decided that a 70 - 30 split is what they want to do for their AWD.

I just don't believe the majority is driving close enough to the limit to really benefit.\\n\\nAgain, it's who are they trying to appeal to? I've read on BMW boards and actually heard from my salesperson of people who bought the 330i Performance Package and then found it was too rough for their liking. BMW didn't make that package for everyone...my brother in law (owns a 325i) thinks my car is too fast, too loud and too rough. To each his own.\\n\\nAutomakers make cars for the majority because they have to stay in business. Those automakers who participate in racing use it as development and eventually pass on what they learn to their production models.\\n\\nYou're missing the point of you don't just want a wide market but also find ways to nail the smaller niche that will pay extra. I love the visual concept of the TL someone posted here...300 HP, 18s, etc. The car just needs the right drivetrain.\\n\\nNear luxury performance sedans are not race cars. They are a little bit of luxury and a little bit of performance. Some lean more towards one than the other and we make our choices accordingly. $35K these days gives you some very nice choices and in the end I still think they are all very close in any comparison you do. I think the car I bought has excellent performance, safety, luxury and yes it has FWD.\\n\\nIt's important that we like what we buy. Hopefully Acura will offer something by 2006 that will get me to buy from them. I want to give Honda my money but I also want to like the car I drive. Give me a sweet honda tranny, at least 270 hp and AWD and I'll be a happy monkey.\\n\\nIt's not worth the risk to four wheel drift on the open road these days. It's roulette..John Law is waiting for you right around the corner.\\nThe racetrack is the place to play.\\n\\nCops...argh. In San Diego the CHP has gone from annoying to fascist. Apparently the head [non-permissible content removed] in Sacramento said speeders are evil and instead of looking for real crime the cops should harass us.

The funnest thing of owning a G has been minor tweaks and little money that create small incrimental gains that I can notice and tweak. Do one and then do another down the road while appreciating each tweak on its own is my philosophy.

For another 120 I added no real gains with my Hyper Grounding Kit but added much smoothness and better responsiveness while eliminating the gurgle the intake created. For another 450 I bought a Crawford Z car intake plenum which adds 20hp. So for less than 1k I got about 20-25 HP at peak, increased the sound quality of the motor, get better gas mileage (4-5 mpg), have a smoother idle and start up and I don't have the HP drop at 6000.\\n\\nIf they offered a $6000 nismo package I' say no, do the perf mods myself and save $5000 on body kit bolt ons that will never work out as well as if bolted on at the plant in the first place.\\n\\nNow I belive I am running Z power at the crank anyway - weight diff is about 150#.

That said, between the 325i and the 330i, and again between the 330i and the 330i ZHP, one would be hard pressed to match the full package of the more expensive car for the same money, to say nothing of having a factory warranty on the extra goodies.

It\\'s fun to drive, economical (31 mpg on the highway), reliable (two years old and no unscheduled trips to the dealership), good looking inside and out, luxurious, certainly fast enough to get my attention, and capable enough to deal with it\\'s power and ability to go fast. What do I mean by that last bit? On the autobahn during my ED trip, I was tooling along at the speed limiter (128.5 mph) when a motorcycle pulled out directly in front of me doing something like 60 mph. I performed an emergency lane change (unfortunately when he saw me in the mirror he did the same, keeping him directly in my sights), and then performed what could best be described as an anchor dropping test of the brakes. At our closest we only got within two feet of each other (him under full acceleration and me in panic stop mode) so he still had a little margin for his error and as such, he lived for another day (hopefully).\\n\\nHaving said all of that, I have been reading here that there are certain cars of a similar price and size with bigger (if not substantially bigger) motors that are \"superior\" vehicles for the money. Uh-huh, right. I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is. To my way of thinking, that\\'s the easy part, and that it\\'s the rest of the package that makes the \"Upgraded\" car truly superior. Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.\\n\\nBalance, that\\'s what the BMW offers, and yes, on paper it will certainly cost more for what you seem to get.

Uh-huh, right. I suppose anybody can throw a big engine in any given car and proclaim it superior to other similar cars with smaller engines, and I suppose to their way of thinking, it is. To my way of thinking, that\\'s the easy part, and that it\\'s the rest of the package that makes the \"Upgraded\" car truly superior. Would a CTS-V for instance, have acquitted itself as perfectly as my 530i did in the above situation? Unknown, but I suspect that the CTS-V is likely to have a much greater front end weight bias, and as such would not have been able to perform the lane change and the deceleration without hitting the individual on the bike after his ill advised maneuver.\"\\n\\nLet me setup a scenario: You go to the track to race somebody in a CTS-V, or even - say - a Pontiac GTO. After they smoke you, you get out - fuming mad - and shout: \"Well, my car has more horsepower per liter! That\\'s all that counts. That\\'s what makes my engine superior. They cheated! They have more displacement\".\\n\\nSound absurd to you? Well, that\\'s what your argument amounts to. This is a miserable debate - born out of lies and advertising propaganda - that repeats itself each hour of the day all over car forums on the internet, by people who overpaid for imports (with engines that the dealers said is superior to anything made in America) and then end up getting owned by folks driving cars with \"old-tech\" OHV engines.\\n\\nA couple of clowns who write for auto publications have decreed that it\\'s better to produce additional power by revving at higher RPM\\'s than it is by increasing displacement. Why? Because they said so. Because they have English degrees (and no science training) from 3rd rate universities to back it up. That\\'s why. And anyone who challenges this orthodoxy is labelled a luddite.\\n\\nI suppose for you old dudes, it\\'s kind of like Vietnam. \"They lied to us man, they lied to us!!!\" =]\\n\\nNow the 2004 BMW 530 isn\\'t a bad car, but it is overpriced.

In their home markets, they have moronic laws that tax based on engine displacement. That\\'s why they shift development dollars to those high revving buzzboxes. When displacment is limited, and you\\'re making a 6 or 8 cyllinder engine, you\\'ll get more power out of DOHC, even though OHV has a higher power density (which I will explain in a minute).\\n\\nSecond, displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size. Repeat after me kiddies: displacement tells you NOTHING about an engines actual size. GM\\'s LS6, for example, is smaller than Nissan\\'s 3.5L VQ (a V6 engine). OHV engines have more compact packaging than DOHC\\'s. That\\'s why the LS6 has such high power density, unmatched by anything that BMW has got.\\n\\nThird, the LS6 also produces power in a more fuel efficient manner than BMW\\'s M5 and M3 engines. It\\'s smaller, more fuel efficient, and more powerful. I fail to see what - if any - the redeeming aspects of BMW\\'s M engines are. And keep in mind, I\\'m talking about the M engines. Your 530 engine isn\\'t even in this league.\\n\\nFinally, I don\\'t know where you got the impression that your 530 can outhandle a CTS-V. The CTS-V smoked the BMW M5 and M3 on the Nurburgring.

So Audi, but no VW; Acura, but no Honda; Infinity, but no Nissan; etc. However, if said brand has no upscale counterpart (i.e., Subaru, Saab, MB, BMW, Volvo, etc.), then it can be considered on its own merits. Of course, that still leaves us with the problem of someone complaining the STi should be included although it doesn't even offer a stereo.

We've got a company well known for mechanical and electrical problems offering a high priced luxo-cruiser under the same banner as 16k economy cars and the new car most closely resembles a 23-40k mid-size sedan. That's just brilliant.\\n\\nGosh, I sure hope Ford comes out with a plus-sized version of the Taurus and sells it for 50k. That'd be keen.\\n\\nBranding. That's what it's all about in the luxury arena. Ask MB about the Maybach.\", \"The Phaeton will be a bigger and much costlier bust than the W8 Passat which went nowhere in sales.

Why not promote the A8 more which never was a big seller instead of handicaping it with a near twin.

But if you like the interior and isolation, this is probably a really good car.\\n\\nDrove the 9-5 aero, that was probably my favorite, i really like the looks, interior, the actual out the door price ( they have $6000 in rebates on it now and sell at invoice(??) ) and i love the engine. But it didn't handle as well as the cts or the c320.\\n\\nThe 9-3 was there but it was the base 9-3 linear and didn't impress, mostly due to the interior. The engine needed more power, but the handling was really quite good. it tracked well and had good feedback. I recently sat in a 9-3 convertable at the autoshow later and thought that the interior in it was really nice, so maybe it's improved.\\n\\nAlso saw the s40 at the autoshow, and the interior really looked cheap to me, and there were several broken parts inside, which i guess could have been due to it's being a prototype and suffering autoshow abuse.

The car looks really good, i thought, and the interior is very attractive, but again there were 3 demos at the dealer and 2 had broken parts inside ( one had the cell phone cover broken by the dealership owner ). All the driving controls felt too light to me, and the engine despite its increased HP felt weak at low RPM's--i didn't feel that i could pass on the highway without dropping out of fifth, but i thought it sounded great when i revved it up. I didn't feel that i got a lot of steering feedback but it was also impressively quiet on the highway. The door sill was really high and the back doors only opened 45 degrees so it was hard for me to get in the back.\\n\\nI drove a new 325i and it's good, but i couldn't help but feel that it's been somewhat lexiified. The shifter had vaguer detents and the engine noise and steering effort were dialed down. I might have liked it a lot more if it had the sport package. I don't like the newer bmw designs, and i look askance at the increasing complexity of these cars.\\n\\nI drove a g35, too, it certainly had a lot of power, and had pretty good feedback. I was mostly turned off by the interior which i felt was pretty cheap and the amount of tire noise that got into the interior ( too much for my tastes ). Also, my friend who has one reports really poor MPG.\\n\\nOh, test drove the is300 as well. I thought it looked ( WARNING: personal taste issue ) tacky inside, and was too consistently noisy due to road noise. Also, the interior didn't fit my frame very well.

In the long run they determine whether any model continues in production based on the manufacturer\\'s defined return on investment. Sales determine whether a manufacturer makes changes to an existing model to improve sales or whether they decide to introduce a new model.\\nSales figures certainly do not denote superiority in terms of styling, performance, handling, etc but they do denote what combination of these the consumer prefers. The wholesale increase in HP across most of the models in this discussion is an example. I am amused by the comments I see here insinuating that \"Joe Blow\" buys mediocre cars and some individuals are above that because they buy cars that they have somehow defined as \"different\". Superiority in the marketplace is what every manufacturer is seeking. That marketplace is however defined differently by different manufacturers. Ferrari does not have the same sales goals as Honda, Nissan, Toyota but they do have some numbers they want to meet in order to maintain their place in whatever market they decide is important to them.\\nYou can\\'t discount sales as a very important indicator. The reference to McDonalds is an attempt to deride one of the most globally successful businesses. It doesn\\'t matter if Joe Blow eats there and you don\\'t. Other businesses would kill for McDonald\\'s success in their market. Freedom of choice is a wonderful thing. The marketplace inevitably determines what survives and sales figures are the feedback from the marketplace to the manufacturers. It will also inevitably determine what you get on your new car in the future.

Top gear times impacted by the depth of overdrive: the TSX's 6th is a very deep .66 overdrive vs IS300's .85.\\n\\nBut compare to some Automobile (10/03) data, both manual transmissions--IS300 then TSX\\n\\n0-60 mph: 7.0 secs vs. 8.1\\n0-100 mph: 18.7 secs vs 21.l\\n0-110 mph: 23.0 secs vs 26.6\\n1/4 mile: 15.4 secs @ 92 mph vs 16.1 @ 89 mph\\n30-70 mph: 8.8 secs vs 8.6\\n70-0 braking: 183 ft vs 183\\n\\nThe differences in acceleration numbers are quite interesting.

I think it might be available on 05TL.\\n\\n>>>\\nHonda Develops World&#146;s First Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive Available this fall in the Acura RL (North America) and the Legend (Japan)\\n\\nTOKYO - April 1, 2004 --- Honda Motor Co., Ltd. today announced the development of a new Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive system, called SH-AWD, that provides cornering performance that responds faithfully to driver input, and outstanding vehicle stability. A world&#146;s first, the SH-AWD system combines front-rear torque distribution control with independently regulated torque distribution to the left and right rear wheels to freely distribute the optimum amount of torque to all four wheels in accordance with driving conditions. The new system will be available this fall in the Acura RL (North America) and the Legend (Japan).\\n\\nBy monitoring driver input and driving conditions, the SH-AWD system determines the optimum front-rear and lateral (left-right) torque distribution. This information is then conveyed to the rear differential, where direct electromagnetic clutches continuously regulate and vary front-rear torque distribution between ratios of 30:70 and 70:30, and lateral torque distribution in the rear wheels between ratios of 100:0 and 0:100. Torque is used not only for propulsion, but for cornering as well, resulting in a significant enhancement in vehicle maneuverability.\\n\\nThe SH-AWD system is composed of sensors to detect steering angle, lateral g, and other vehicle information; an ECU; and the rear differential. The direct electromagnetic clutches inside the rear differential, another world&#146;s first, employ electromagnets to obtain precise control over the multi-plate clutches. Built-in search coils monitor the gaps between the electromagnets and the magnetic body to achieve precise, continuously variable torque regulation.\\n\\nThe rear differential is also equipped with a built-in acceleration device, yet another world&#146;s first. During cornering, the track of the outside rear wheel normally falls outside the average of the tracks of the front wheels. The outside rear wheel does not rotate fast enough to keep up with the front wheels, preventing efficient transmission of torque. To counteract this problem, the SH-AWD acceleration device alters the gearing to speed up the outside rear wheel&#146;s rotation relative to the front wheels. This reduces torque transmission losses and significantly improves vehicle maneuverability.\\n\\nAt Honda, driving pleasure is regarded as one of the most important factors in vehicle development. The new SH-AWD system features &#147;feed-forward&#148; control, which utilizes the degree of driver input to determine appropriate torque distribution. This results in a super-neutral steering feel that responds with optimal faithfulness to the driver&#146;s handling of the steering wheel, realizing outstanding driving comfort and stability.\\n\\nFrom official Honda Japan site...\\nhttp://www.honda.co.jp/HDTV/news/2004-4040401a/', \"You're right there is no accounting for taste obviously, but it was nothing personal sorry you took it that way.

Now we can debate endlessly on whether that matters to an individual. But the question is, how acceptable is it in the near-entry level sports sedan segment?\\n\\nThe G35 debate was different in that it got down to the precision handling of a 330 vs the more \"family oriented value\" of the G35 with less \"precision and finesse\".

I think price, Honda reputation and standard equipment drive the majority of TL sales and always have. A comparable equipment wise 330i would run well over 5k more.

It's only when adding price that they win some of the comparo....and to some buyers, price wasn't the determining issue when buying a car for fun. Afterall, it's a toy. If i'm tossing 33k on a car, 6k more is not that big of a deal in the scheme of things. If 6k means 10% more happiness, the trade off is a no brainer, in my opinion.\\n\\nI think in the end I'm buying my sports sedan for a different reason: fun.

The only one I didn't consider was Honda/Acura. I had a really bad ownership experience with a Honda some years ago..and can't bring myself to buy another.\\n   For what I am looking for in a car at this point in my life, the CTS fit the bill better then anything else.

At upper highway speeds the G may have a chance to outshine a tad.\\n\\nAnd really price is an issue or we'd all be in maserati or lambo.

FUN! I want to own this thing for 200k miles or 10 years which ever comes first (10 years is looking good).\\n\\nWhy would a BETTER air intake manifold setup hurt the car? If the intake plenum itself goes then you get a new one from Doug...and the only ones to go have been covered by him even though they were all FI induced blowouts of the plenum at the weld points - yer talking 450 hp cars here!\\n\\nGiven that you have effectively improved the car, lets hope you didn't drop any bolts or dirt into the intake runners... IF the day you put the plenum on the car doesn't work becasue you didn't install it correctly - you're on your own. But if you put the plenum on and there is a problem with your air flow sensor or the exhaust manifold cracks - well they would have to prove that your mod casued the problem. Casue and effect are hard for them to come up with in the most clear cut cases. The MM act is a good one to get to know. It puts the burden of proof on the dealer. Proven effective mods that dont harm the engine from reputable race teams or proven mod experts is harmless fun to me. Is there risk - sure. But a better design like a plenum that offers better airflow and less air fuel ratio differential for each cylinder (or more even distribution of the same air) is not going to casue you any problems (dont take my word for it call doug or think physics). THis is no where near the modification level of a forced induction system or something that makes the engine work hotter, faster, more...this makes it work more efficiently with the existing conditions - ala the better gas mileage.\\n\\nAdding 40 hp tp this car is not going to hurt it one iota. Studying the VQ for the last few months while researching the viability of lightweight underrive crank pulley I learned that the VQ may be the most naturally balanced and most durable engine ever built with 6 holes. From the cylinder bank angle to the internal balancing to the tranny that handles 340hp in a v-8 platform from the Q...it all adds up to me no longer worrying about things that wont hurt my engine.

Sometimes any mod, weather related to the warranty repair or not is enough for them to deny you warranty coverage. You shouldn't have a problem with the VQ, because it is a very sturdy engine, but just in case, be prepared to fight if you go to your Infiniti dealership for warranty repair that relates to engine or tranny.\", \"My dealer actually installed the crank pulley for me. There has never been a case where a pulley casued a VQ motor to fail.\\n\\nWhen i show up at the dealer the techs come running to see what I'v been working on and many are incorporating my mods into thier own maxima's and G's. Many dealers sell the pulley and many have installed the plenum (not mine). Some infiniti dealership will give you a hard time as they are not mod friendly...a hard time is easliy overcome with knowledge about your rights as a consumer.

Point being - some dealers will TRY to blackball you but the ability they have to actually deny warranty service is against them and thier wishes to make things go away if they think you will because they attribute your problem to your mods.

They make a balanced daily driver out of a Z platform with all the give and take of design, functionality, $, platform selection, engine availabilty.

As stupid as they are they still got 287 HP out of NA v-6.\\n\\nAnother whopping 8% in power shouldn\\'t be so hard to believe. 20hp is alot but it doesn\\'t change the car. Break in is also responsible for the add;l mileage I qouted and I would attribute the plenum to a 4 mpg increase on the highway. While the bolt on outfits may not impress you (have you been to one) the fact is these guys race weekly and know more about engineering and cars and speed and motors than you\\'d ever believe.\\n\\nThere are plenty of Z cars out there running 330 hp totally N/A. This should be easily believable so to think that I can\\'t get to 300 or so with $1500 in a G with the same platform and same motor give an intake tube and a minor exhaust difference. You guys driving LS\\'s and 3 series and TL\\'s may have your motor on edge cominng out of the factory - mine has 30% more to give and as they release newer versions of the G they will have add\\'l power as well. 330 hp in the new m45 from the same VQ3.5 is probable if not foreseeable. Tinkering is not so bad guys - 3500 members giving thorough analysis to this and many other great tweaks such as a FREE airbox mod and tons others plus the support of a hundred thousand crazy Z owners can find plenty wrong with those yucky engineers at nissan and thier crap designs.

I wonder what that number would be?', \"1) There is no possible way a dealer will attribute a non moving part to any detontation or worst case you can dream of.

I\\'ve never seen a mod on any car that increase performance and gas mileage at the same time. If that were the case there would be a mod that increases gas mileage thorough the roof, I\\'m still waiting for one of them. You must be the only one that gets better performance, more pulling power and a whoppping increase in overall gas mileage. Why do you think the Subaru 2.5 engine can get an abysmal 14mpg? Yeah, it produces and it is FA, but there is a cost. There is always a cost. While your discussion at face value sounds nice, I do not buy any of it, because there is no way to measure it, only your conjecture about your interpetation. I\\'m not saying don\\'t mod the car, but I do not believe any engine mod such as you did is the holy grail and in fact will not lead to warranty problems down the line. But it\\'s okay, it\\'s not my car, you don\\'t have to convince me.', \"I wont try and convince you but i wont let other G owner be steered astray by falsities or misinformation.\\n\\nMOST mods that improve performance also improve gas mileage if they relate to A/F ratio increases. If I put a plenum on my car and the air flow is better and my A/F ratio is better the effect is a more effecient car. If you suggest that I can get 4 mpg only from my dreams then perhaps once you have some expereince in modding cars lightly you can join my dream. If you haven;t modded a car you may not understand that air is your friend and air is free. It contains the O2 that powers the little pistons with the help of a detonating catalyst (petrol). The more air in the ratio the more power is extracted given a FIXED amount of fuel.\\n\\nI have a hard time seeing where you miss this but look at it this way. If the A/F ratio is 10 to 1 stock and I put a mod on that gets me 12 to 1 (which most intake mods do add air!) the results are more power which = less work for the motor for the same loads and speeds = better gas milage. Most people driving modded G's are there reporting 25-29. Most stock ones are 17-23.

These same safey regs give American cars that have headrests (important in a rear collision) that \"rests\" in the small of your back and don\\'t come anywhere near protecting your actual \"head\" a \"five star\" safety rating. A Kia is now as safe as a Volvo? Ok right.\\n\\nThere are pictures all over the net of Mercedes and Volvos that have been completely demolished up to the A-Pillar and the glass didn\\'t even break!

If you check into Insurance data in Europe on European cars you\\'ll see where Volvo, Renault, Mercedes and others have proven they are safer than the majority of Japanese cars. It is well documented that Mercedes, Volvo and Porsche in particular addressed certain safety issues (like rear impacts) before Toyota, Honda, GM, Ford even began to research the problem.

The later usually has much more heavy doors too. Just think it simple, throw an egg and a stone (may not be that extreme but it is just an example) to the wall. Which one will have fewer damages ?

I try to autocross at least once per year, finnally getting the G on the track. When I was in Germany the BMW went to Hockenheim and Nurburgring. I will say right now that the BMW has a better balance of firmness and compliance in everyday driving. But these are my on track observations.\\n\\nThe BMW will hit precisely on the marks lap after lap. The BMW understeers. Slow speed corners can be a challenge because the chassis must be &#147;flicked&#148; into the corner. By this I mean as you come into a slow (sub 30 mph) tight corner the balance of the BMW must be purposely upset to allow for better rotation of the nose. Normally this can be done with the throttle on most rear drivers but the BMW tucks it&#146;s tail and digs during WOT corner exit. The suspension in the BMW is better at soaking up track irregularities. Mid corner bumps don&#146;t usually cause you to run wide or have to lift for fear of rotation. BMW sport suspension handles multiple corners like S-curves very well. Threshold braking is linear with zero fade. The BMW is surgical, precise, capable and unflappable.\\n\\nHaving said all that about the BMW the G is ultimately more capable mostly because of more power. It takes a better driver than me to wring out everything the G has to offer. The G takes a few more course corrections. The G is easier to modulate with the throttle. The G can be coaxed to drift easier and superior torque can make for terrifying exit speeds. I can run out of track and talent with the G&#146;s go pedal. Tight corners can be dispatched easily with a touch of throttle-on oversteer. Track irregularities can upset the G&#146;s chassis during threshold braking and the rear can definitely step out on fast sweepers. The G does not transition very well during multi-corner maneuvers. There is more bobbing as the dampers fight to control pitch and roll. Once the G is set though it&#146;s time to dial in the throttle and ROCKET. The G is powerful, visceral, involved, and ultimately more rewarding to drive fast.\\n\\nOn a road course I believe a novice driver could drive a BMW and post better times than in a G. A skilled driver in a G would post better times than in a BMW. For me, it would probably be a wash depending on the length of the straightaway. Ultimately, I enjoy both cars greatly and am fortunate to have owned both and gotten to test each cars limits within a safe, controlled environment.', \"Blueguy\\x85 You think the Miata is cool?

I have been following this board for over a year and have found the discussions both interesting and insightful. This fall I intend to purchase either a new ('05) 240 (elegance) or BMW 325i. I have only owned and driven Corolla's in the past, on average keeping them 12 years...they have only ever been great cars. In terms of reliability, they are my standard. But I'm ready to try something more upscale now and after a fair amount of research it has come down to the 2 fine cars mentioned above.

Many people think that their technology is outdated and the 9-3 interior not not good.\\n\\nWell, I looked at the 2006 A4 report in Edmunds yesterday. It mentioned that Audi added twin balance shafts that spin at twice the engine speed to A4 to minimize vibration.\\n\\n\"Balance shafts\" ? Sounds familiar. I checked both my 2001 9-3 & 9-5 owner\\'s manuals and found that both cars were equipped with 2 balance shafts at that time. I am not sure when Saab put those in their cars.\\n\\nI remembered I asked an Audi Salesperson whether the auto tranny of an A4 can learn the driver\\'s driving style (adaptive transmission ??) and he told me no.\\n\\nI think Saab has some nice and unique features that they didn\\'t mention to people. Not that many people know Saab came up the idea of headlight wipers, heated seats, etc. The Marketing dept should be responsible for that.\\n\\nNow 9-3 is more mainsteam. Maybe most people like it better than the old one. I missed the hatch. It needs something more than 210hp. Saab should create something like the Viggen with AWD for the 9-3 (I heard there will be a 9-3 sport hatch but AWD may not be an option).', 'Hmm--that was how i felt about the \\'900 i used to have. That car had lots of great features with a few glaring oversights/shortcomings. I also had the BMW then, which had fewer \"gee, neat\" features and less utility ( hatch, interior room ) but no real shortcomings i cared about. For example, the BMW engine didn\\'t have that hammer-you-into the seat torque blast, with that cool motorcycle sound, but it didn\\'t have the turbo lag either. The saab was sort of a headache and i chose to keep the BMW but i miss that car in general.\\n\\nI recently seriously considered getting either a 9-3 or a 9-5. I really like them both but each had something that made me say \"wait\" although i was contemplating pulling the trigger in each case, once with a 9-5 aero ( used, 3000 miles ) and the other time with a new ARC. Both manual transmission. The 9-5\\'s bane was handling/turbo lag and the 9-3\\'s was the el cheapo GM interior. Both could be fixed, of course. I think simply sticking the ecotec in the 9-5 would improve it a lot; it\\'s a lighter smaller engine ( for better weight distribution) with less turbo lag. The ecotec is also smoother. Another thing that irked me is the nature of the turbo with stick. You have to shift really fast or boost is largely lost between shifts. It\\'s find if you\\'re driving \"all out\" but not so great for maneuvers in traffic. Sort of the opposite of the GTO my cousin wants me to get. Even with my BMW i can start moving without using the gas, just easing in the clutch, while i felt quite choppy in both the saabs when starting off.\\n\\nThe lack of the hatch also miffed me.\\n\\nStill, I\\'d rather have a car i really like with a few bugs than a car that is mostly \"reliable.\" Kind of like dating the awesome girl with a few issues vs miss boring.

I intend to keep my options (esp electronic) to a minimum as I find the models well equipped and the less electronics (IMO) the better.\\n\\nI have found the stereo on my 14 year old toyota very good. I am not an audiophile, so would I notice or appreciate an upgraded sound system on either of these cars? I don\\'t expect the standard system to be excellent, but is is at least \"Good\"?\\n\\nI have to say I find the exterior of the BMW very appealing over that of the MB, but the interior of the MB has the BMW beat. I love the comfortable sumptuousness of the MB interior.\\n\\nMy travel needs are modest. I will only put low city miles on it, will get the extended warranty, will \"baby\" it, and hope to keep it for 8 - 10 years.\\n\\nWhile I think and feel both cars are excellent ( I find both engines more that adequate for my driving needs) I am inclined towards the 240. However my biggest reservation comes from concerns over MB quality. I understand it is not what it has been. I also understand that they are intentional about addressing this issue. I also read the the C class was early on plagued with \"bugs\". This was esp true in the 2001 and possible 2002 model years. Can I assume that most of these C class \"bugs\" have been addressed? What has been the experience of those who own 2002/03/04 vehicles?

All season tires are not very safe for winter driving in a city like Winnipeg and especially if you are going to baby it. I would consider looking at the 4matic and the xi too. Just my 2 cents.', 'I&#146;ve had my &#146;04 325i for about 5 months now, so I feel qualified to evaluate it and compare it to my previous car, a &#146;98 Audi A4 1.8T. These cars are similarly equipped, manual trans, non-sport package with all-seasons, about the same size and performance category, so a comparison seems fair at this point.\\n\\nENGINE &#150; Well, the 325 is rated at 35hp over the A4, so it&#146;s pretty much no contest. The engine is also smoother and really begs to be revved. The Audi would spool up pretty well, too, but I always felt like I was straining it a bit. I am also not sorry to lose the turbo, as I have always felt they add complexity under the hood that could be a long-term problem. In fact, the only major repair that I had to pay for on the A4 was a $500+ turbo-related issue.\\n\\nTRANSMISSION &#150; Pretty even here with both being 5-speeds. The Audi had a bit softer of a clutch vs. the BMW&#146;s abruptness. I am only now at the point where I can consistently make a really smooth 1-2 shift.\\n\\nHANDLING &#150; This is my first RWD car in many years, and I forgot how different it feels. The crisp turn-in is especially noticeable, and the steering overall has better feel than the A4. Ride-wise, the cars are pretty comparable: well controlled, firm but never harsh over rough pavement, typically German. The one thing the A4 had going for it was of course the Quattro AWD. One of my favorite things to do (you&#146;re never too old to be immature) was to out-drag someone at a stoplight on wet pavement. I could pretty well mash the pedal to the floor coming out and the car would just GO, leaving the other guy spinning his front (or rear) wheels. Even with traction control on a RWD or FWD, you&#146;re not going to beat AWD in slippery conditions.\\n\\nINTERIOR &#150; Audi is known for interior design and the A4 did have very nice styling and controls layout. The BMW is not as well coordinated, but is a bit more business-like in its appearance. However, I like my particular color combination better than the A4&#146;s. The sand leatherette along with black floormats and dash, set off by the premium wood trim, makes for a nice look as opposed to the A4 that was all gray with some silver trim pieces. The leatherette in the BMW is also a bit nicer-appearing than the A4&#146;s.\\n\\nThe automatic climate control on the BMW is not quite as good at regulating temperature and air movement as the Audi&#146;s. The fan seems to blow too high in some conditions and not fast enough in others. The Audi definitely had the best auto-temp control that I have experienced.\\n\\nEXTERIOR &#150; At the time that I picked out my A4, it was the E36 that I compared it against and I thought the A4 was better looking. But ever since the E46 came out the next year, my eye was always drawn to them when I spied one. I still think, though, that the A4 has classic good looks that I prefer to the newer model that was released in &#146;01. Likewise I expect that I will still prefer the E46 after the E90 comes out.\\n\\nRADIO &#150; No contest here: the Audi had a much superior standard radio. On a few occasions, I&#146;ve wondered if the CDs that I&#146;m playing in the BMW are the same ones that I used to play in the A4.\\n\\nINTANGIBLES &#150; I am not a status seeker, but from the reaction of many people that I know I can see that the BMW nameplate carries a lot more prestige than most others. Everyone knows what a BMW is, whereas I think that Audi is less known and tends to get lumped with other second-tier European cars. There is something about seeing that roundel on the steering wheel that makes me feel extra good about my choice.\\n\\nSUMUP &#150; The 325i feels like a small performance sedan with luxury appointments and options; the A4 is more of a small luxury sedan that performs well.

Competent handling and decent brakes, but tended to understeer at the limit, leading me to plow one hard corner. Racy interior with easy to use controls. A \"good value\" choice if price and reliability are your top concerns in this segment. The car for my younger brother.\\n\\nInfiniti G35: POWER! Oh, baby, this one has an engine. The interior was not as bad to drive as others would lead you to believe, but the handling is beneath the balance of the BMW and the Lexus. This is a car that makes the average driver (me) look bad. Saved by ABS and the traction control system from a potentially scary rear end spin. G35 owners have a reasonably priced, family-sized car with V8-like power, but you can only put it down on the track if you really know what you are doing. The car for a coworker who drag races on the weekends and takes four to lunch during the week.\\n\\nAcura TL: If I were picking a car for my wife, sister, real estate agent, etc., this would be the one. Beautiful, jewel-like interior with state-of-the-art sound and ALL the features at a decent price. Plenty of power for the street. It just doesn\\'t handle like a sport sedan with front wheel drive.\\n\\nMercedes C320: Softer ride, less-powerful engine, smooth transmission, nice interior. Others do different parts better at lower price points. Nice car, but nothing special for the money, pass. If you got the bucks and want the star, think AMG.\\n\\nBMW 330i: OK, I\\'m biased, but this car makes the average driver look good with an ideal balance of engine, transmission, handling, and braking in a driver-oriented interior. Drove a premium packaged car with steptronic. Moving the shifter inboard to Sport and touching the DSC once (I didn\\'t turn it off iaw the \"rules\"), and the car performs: powerful acceleration (outmatched only by the G35), quick redline shifts that were the best, great brakes, and incredibly BALANCED handling. I was foot to the floor, threshold braking, hands spinnning the wheel, and having the time of my life. Much faster car for me because of the control available. The standard 330i is under tired (get the sport package for the performance tires, sport seats, and steering wheel). The steptronic (evaluated in \"S\" mode) was much better than I expected. Give me a little more power, more tire, and a manual - oh, that\\'s my ZHP. I was still amazed at what a standard 330i can do, driven much harder than I\\'ve ever driven my car, which I have yet to track.', \"jamesspot... What were the MSRPs for the respective vehicles? Too bad they were all automatics. (Amazes me that Lexus didn't use the 325ia. 325i outsells the 330i by about a factor of 3-to-1. 325i prices out, with similar options like an IS300. A decently optioned 330i can quickly push $40,000. Did the IS300 have optional LSD and VSC?)\", \"We just went from car to car. They had info posters highlighting the specs of each of the automobiles. Lexus was amazingly fair in their presentation of all the cars.\\nThe class groupings had the IS300 with the G35 and the 330i, the ES330 (which I didn't drive) was grouped with the C320 and the TL.\\nThe G35 and IS300 are low 30's cars, while a 330i step with premium package and the C320 are pushing 40k.\\nThe IS300 did have traction control, I didn't know whether it had LSD or not.\\nI agree - the 325i is an even match for the IS300 price wise, the 330i is a much more expensive and capable car.\\nSince the event was for the general public invited by Lexus marketing, automatics were the only game in town for every car there.

Even my buddy, who\\'s a huge honda fan, didn\\'t like it. I think the TSX is significantly more fun. OTOH, the TL compares quite well with the c320.\\n\\nThe CTS is allright, i just think the interior needs to be upgraded, and it definitely needs the sport package. Same with the 9-3.\\n\\nI may be biased, but even my honda-loving GM mechanic buddy liked the 2 bmw\\'s the best. The 530 with the sport package was simply phenomenal.\\n\\nBut that\\'s off-topic.\\n\\nI also had a chance to drive the s40 t5 AWD. I really like the design, cabin, and volvo\\'s environmental focus. I think it\\'s a pretty good car, aside from fairly significant turbo lag. Oddly, it seems to me to have more lag with it\\'s 2.5L than saab\\'s almost-as-powerful 2.0L. It also still feels like a FWD car even with AWD. So, pretty nice, but not quite as sporty as i like. I like that you can get a \"high end\" car without leather and wood, neither of which i really care for.\\n\\nI think i\\'ll end up waiting to test the new 3-series before i order anything.

A couple of hundred miles passes with ease, which, despite their many supposed faults, is true of larger American vehicles. The TSX is more alive in your hands, less relaxed, ultimately not as fast.\\n\\nThe TL's clutch is fierce, but the shift is nice once you get used to it. Drive something else for a while and I guarantee you'll engage 1st with a bang when you next drive the TL.

Worked like a charm.\\n\\nI'm going to put on a set of snow tires for my '04 IS300 sedan. I'm still deciding. Looking at Dunlop Snow Sport M3s or Michelin Arctic Alpin. I'll likely make my mind up this week.\\n\\nDon't forget that taller, narrower winter tires work best. So for me that means going from 17 inch to 16 inch tires.\", \"I really like the Arctic Alpin tires (LOTS of grip in the slippery stuff, quiet on dry pavement), that said, given their 100 mph limit, I'm probably inclined to spend an extra $20 or so per tire next time and buy something like the Michelin Pilot Alpin PA2 tires. Yeah, yeah, I know, I live in New England and cannot REALLY use a tire with a higher speed rating all that often, that said, last winter on one of my trips to NYC, I was on the Mass Pike tooling along with a group of about 6 cars at about 100 when another group of about 10 cars caught us and passed us. The cars in my group accelerated and joined the larger group, that is, except me. :-(\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo\", '\"Hmmm, the cost of my winter set is less than a fifth of the extra taxes that I\\'d be paying per year if I lived in California, that and my 1,500 square foot basement has LOTS of space to store a set if tires.

Also, my wife is from CA . Hence why I have to buy her an AWD car (xi) AND equip it with Blizzaks.\\nI have read previously that a RWD car is easier to drive UP a hill than a FWD car equipped with comparable tires due to the weight shift to the rear.\\nYou may want to consider that in your decision.', 'Oddly enough, my wife is from California as well. This whole winter thing is still a little new to her, even after living in the NYC metro area for over a dozen years and now our third winter in NH. Me, I originally hail from Michigan although I too lived in CA for several years. In the end, I had to move back up north, I missed winter too much and weekend visits up to Mammoth just didn\\'t give me enough of a fix. ;-)\\n\\nRegarding UP hill in a RWD car, yes, I believe that depending upon the situation it is easier, assuming you can maintain enough momentum to keep the front wheels rolling fast enough to allow you enough steerage to correct for the resultant fish-tailing. Yikes, what a sentence (my Mom was an english teacher). :-/ That said, of all the cars that I\\'ve ever owned, my hill climbing champ was indeed a car setup in the FWD configuration, my 1982 Audi 4000. Talk about low-tech FWD! How on earth could that have been my best climber? Simple, in reverse. ;-) I was on my way to an assignation which included an almost empty rental ski condo, a hot fire and good food and wine, up in Boyne City, MI and all that stood between me and Valhalla was a VERY steep, slippery, snow and ice covered dirt road. After several attempts to climb the hill nose first, I sat at the bottom for a few minutes and thought about the situation logically. I popped it in reverse, and climbed that hill with absolutely no problem.\\n\\nWhen I pulled up in front of the condo she came out and asked, \"How in the hell did you get your car up here? I needed to park in town and bum a ride from somebody with a Jeep.\"\\n\\nI don\\'t think I ever actually confessed to her that I did it in reverse. ;-)\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', 'hmm... have you considered g35x? its got awd for sure\\nand no belive me you dont want summer tires in heavy snow, it almost got me killed once though i dont know how much it snows in DC, but it cant be worse than minneapolis right?', 'As Sonny Elliot (sp?), the old Weatherman from Detroit used to say, the folks in the DC area get lots of \"Frizzle\" (freezing rain and drizzle), \"Slice\" (slush that then freezes to ice), and \"Slow\" (sleet and snow mixture). Speaking stictly for myself, I\\'d rather drive in a good old fashioned Minneapolis Snow storm anyday compared to a DC \"Slow\" storm. ;-)\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', 'Alright, I have to throw in two cents to keep this place honest.\\n\\nI used to live in 10,000 feet up in the Colorado Rockies. At first I was intimidated by the thought of snow storms and compromises with mobility. Then I quickly realized that the snow crews are nothing like NYC areas where you sometimes have to wait a day to have roads cleared. In dem dere mountains snow barely had a chance to touch the ground before they would clear the roads (the more populated areas anyway). My brother lived in Montreal and it&#146;s pretty much the same way. So it seems to me that one&#146;s daily conditions play a role when considering winter driving equipment. If you can whisk your way onto clear roads and highway, the risk of getting marooned is considerably lower.\\n\\nI often find myself on lots of hills with plenty of deep stuff and/or ice. I know a thing or two about getting by with two wheels, but nothing beats AWD in snow&#151;nothing. Never even came close to having a snag. You have to use more skill and savvy with the others, like taking circuitous routes home, maintaining momentum into a hill or driving uphill backwards. Not many people would think of these things.\\n\\nI agree that all-season tires are not the way to go with RWD and FWD. They have mostly summer-tire characteristics and I would only use them with AWD. Even then, they compromise traction, braking and handling in snow.\\n\\nBottom line here. Driving in snow with RWD and FWD is like jogging with Florsheim wingtips. Sure, you can do it. But a G35x, 325xi or anything else like this is a great choice.\\n\\nShipo, your Mom should be proud of you&#151;I see nothing wrong with that sentence. I would imagine however that she wouldn&#146;t approve of your 100 mph jaunts ;-)\\n\\nYou CA people must me TOTALLY bored with this stuff. Question\\x85does Santa Claus go to places like San Diego? Indeed, I envy you.', \"I have them on my wife's car.. The handling is incredible.. I'm sure you give up some snow traction to a Q-rated tire, but she never came close to getting stuck last year...

But, if you want to do it all...\\n\\nregards,\\nkyfdx', 'Hmmm, I gotta disagree with you about some if this. I regularly drive two FWD cars and one RWD car shod with winter tires, and I think that there is little comparison, the RWD car seems to have significantly better traction in all driving regimens.

In fact, if I\\'m not mistaken, in the braking department, the RWD car easily won due to its inherently more neutral front/rear weight distribution (especially compared to the FWD A6) combined with its (relatively) lighter weight (compared to the two AWD cars).\\n\\nPersonally, I am willing to give up some \"go power\" to gain some \"stop power\", hence my comment that I believe that a RWD car (especially one with a near neutral weight distribution) shod with winter tires offers the best driving experience for winter driving. That said, if I lived in a mountainous area such as the Rockies, I would certainly opt for the AWD car simply because on a steep enough hill, the FWD/RWD car simply ain\\'t gonna start moving from a standing stop while the AWD car will move away from the stop with relative aplomb. ;-)\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', \"Why do you have 5 & 6 flip-flopped in comparison to 3 & 4?

Not so much the sedan (its looks aren't the best, IMO), but the coupe. I will admit that driving a RWD coupe/sedan is just a completely different experience from a FWD. In this case, different is much better. The handling, acceleration, and braking are all a world better.\\n\\nI am aware of the G35x, but I was really hoping to get the 6-speed.

These quotes included Premium Pkg, Leather, upgraded stereo auto transmission, wood trim. The quotes came from 2 different dealers JMK (325xi) Flemington (330xi). I don't think the mats are typically included in the BMW pricing but I did not really haggle here since I ended up purchasing a G35x.\\n\\n \\n\\nAfter driving all 3 cars I decided on the Infiniti. I think I liked the tighter handling of the BMW but the 325xi just seemed way underpowered compared to a G35x. This just was my feel. I am sure a BMW loyalist would argue I don't know what I am talking about but that is what it felt like to me. The 330xi would have been great. More power than the 325xi and tighter than the G35x but I could not rationalize the additional $6500 in price for a car with less backseat and room with a 3 year old.\\n\\n \\n\\nI saw the posts on the RWD and really cannot comment since I wanted an AWD and only drove them. Again speed and power seemed relative and a RWD was not in the decision set.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe G35x felt nice to me. (My last 2 cars were Maximas) It handled nicely and had plenty of pep. Believe it or not it seemed to run quieter than the 325xi as well.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe last thing is I have had 3 Nissan's and none of them owed me anything when I gave them up (All with 8 - 10 years and 150k+ miles). That was the final factor.\\n\\n \\n\\nI am picking it up tomorrow and assuming I do not jerked around at the last minute my 2005 G35x will cost $34,250 with Premium C Pkg, Full Size Spare and Wood Trim.

We will see.', '\"From January to November, 2004 I drove [and owned] a Acura TL.\"\\n\\nWhy did you own a TL for only 11 months?', 'Any thoughts?', \"After driving a Legacy GT Limited the other day, I'd expect around 18 mpg total and no more than 21 on the freeway. Why? The gearing is not very conducive to getting decent mileage. I was running near 4k rpm at only 75 mph. The car needs an actual freeway gear - something BMW and Acura do and thus they get high freeway mileage.\", \"On another note, drove the 2005 G35 manual sedan. Improvements to the interior are evident immediately. Wow, nice aluminum trim everywhere. Electronic tilt-telescope (if it were bmw I'd expect that would break after 2-3 years). Seats are wide, la-z-boy like. Shifter feels smoother and shorter than that 2003 manual I drove. Engine's got crazy power - pulls like a damn rocket sled. Car still feels lumbering and not very agile even with optional 18s. you sit far too high up so the feeling of speed is more apparent than in the bmw and it ends up making the car feel more like a souped up, decent handling buick with that big interior and so much metal everywhere. fun car for 32k or so. But still think I'd opt for a used bimmer before getting a G35. It still doesn't feel like a legit sport sedan. More a fast sporty sedan. And that engine, while powerful just is too rough when pushed. It sounds like it might break above 5k rpm. No redline on the tach but an annoying light starts to blink at 3500-4k telling me to shift. Dumb design and it makes it impossible to tell the car's real redline.\", 'It was only 10 months. I fully realize that I have a problem. Call it NCL.

And the car\\'s not really useful/ Boxster - not to my liking in any way, shape or form - basically it\\'s just heinous. 911\\'s sweet but not my bag either.

Bland (but styling\\'s pretty unimportant to me) but the possibility of the 3.5 with 300 hp, RWD, lower driving position and lexus reliability, gets my eyebrows up. I\\'m hoping I\\'ve finally found something that can at least run with my E46 and not make pine for it.', \"Chris, nice to see you. And no I don't hate the G35. Far from it. Excellent car that isn't quite there.\\n\\nRegarding seating, lowering the seat would only make me like I'm sitting in a hole and it won't change the fact the car is so damn high.\\n\\nAs for handling - please tell me you'll drive the sport model next time. No one complains in fact the 03 had .9 skidpad and 67 slalom (or 66.5 maybe can't remember) - not exactly lumbering.\\n\\nDrove a G35 manual 05 which comes with the 18s. AFAIK, the manuals come with the sport suspension automatically. If i'm wrong, please correct me. I believe I'm right though (remember I wanted to buy an 03).\\n\\nFor a car the runs with - and not behind the 3 with ZHP pack - sporty sedan is just plain WRONG. You must have been owned by a G some time ago and have a bad thing for them now. You've been trshing them for over a year while the rest of the automotvie community respects that there is a new benchmark until 06 at least.\\n\\nOwned how? I don't race people. I was owned by a G35 03 on a test drive - the car lifted up in the rear on a turn. Unsettling to say the least. IMHO, and it's just my opinion (thought other seem to agree), the G35 does not feel as centered or planted on the tarmac as the 330i zhp. Trust me, I wanted to buy an 03 and I desperately wanted to love the 05 G35. But the car's handling and engine just didn't match my expectations for a car in this class. I would love to be in a reliable, fast, competent, japanese sports sedan (not to mention cheap!). But I can't find one!\", \"And the 06 330 swill seem sluggish compared to a 298hp G for sure. And that crappy handling will be just enough to match anything the 3 has..with more legroom.\\n\\nUh, I haven't touched the 06 3 so I won't comment on the performance. Though I will say I think the body is ugly, interior bland and the size increase totally unwarranted. The e46 was already too porky (not just in weight but also size), so the e90 will get a coutesy test drive when i replace my car but I have very low expectations for the car. And for BMW in general.\\n\\nBTW, my 330i with its measely 235 hp, still pulls perfectly and with no fanfare compared to my experience in the 05 G35. The inline 6 in my ZHP may not be my favorite engine but god, it's so smooth it makes me wonder how Subaru and Infiniti even try to compete with those engines. The racket in the highend is insane.\", \"Actually, the 06 IS300 (with 252) is on my shortlist. I don't care for the exterior or interior but it may have the traits I desire - great handling, RWD (not a fan or AWD or FWD), low seating position (no matter how low you make the seat in a G the car still rides high), bulletproof reliability and of course a decent price.\\n\\nI'm anything but brand loyal. The guys at bimmerfest will atest to how I go rounds regarding my 330i and lousy bmw buid quality.\", '** Also posted this on the Infiniti G35 Sedan and FX35 boards**\\n\\nHi everyone, this is my first post on this board. To give you a little background, I currently own a Mazda MX-6 and my wife drives an Acura MDX. We have a 14 month baby girl, and it is getting very difficult for me to get her in and out of the car seat, if I have to pick her up.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m in the market for a new vehicle. I had wanted to stay with a manual transmission -- I don\\'t have traffic in my commute and prefer the fun and feel of a manual transmission.\\n\\nAnyway, I had narrowed the choice down to the Acura TL 6MT and the Infiniti G35 Sedan with 6MT. After weighing all of the pros and cons, I decided to go with the G35.\\n\\nThen came the baby car seat test, in which the G35 did not do well. The TL has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions. The G35 does not have this.\\n\\nI then tried to put the rear-facing car seat behind the drivers seat and the passengers seat. Even with the seats adjusted to my short 5\\'8\" frame, I found that I had to move the seats too far forward in the G35. The Acura was a tiny bit better in this regard. Since my heart was set on the G35, I was very disappointed in this.\\n\\nWe only have one child now, but hope to have a second one in the future. Meaning that we will probably have both a forward facing toddler seat and a rear facing infant seat in the back. So, I really need a vehicle that can accomodate both.\\n\\nThis brings me to small SUV\\'s. I test drove both the Infiniti FX35 and the Lexus RX330. The Lexus is more practical, but I really prefer the looks and sporty feel of the FX35. I preferred the control and feel of the FX35 sport suspension, with the 20\" wheels, even though the ride was a tad harsher. I live in Dallas, and a RWD car with big wheels will rarely have weather issues to contend with.\\n\\nI would appreciate any advice, especially with regards to the baby car seats, that would help me make my decision. If there are any parents of young children out there that have faced a similar problem recently, I would appreciate your input.\\n\\nI have checked out the Infiniti Snugkids website, but it does not say anything about how to put a car seat in the center position.\\n\\nOne thought is to go with the my first choice, the G35. The problems with the infant car seat will only be for the first couple of years. After which the baby will be in a forward-facing car seat that the G35 can easily accomodate. Do I rule out my #1 choice just because of a car seat? Like I said, I was very disappointed when the G35 did not do well with the car seats. I\\'m beginning to think that all mid-size sedans will have this problem.\\n\\nSorry for the long email. Thanks.', \"Seldom does this subject come up on these boards....it's usually discussed in the minivan threads. My 3 kids are now 8, 6, and 3, so I'm just a few years beyond you. We own an Odyssey and just bought an 05 TL 6MT. One key for us was enough width across the back seat for the 3 kids, 2 of them in booster seats. Narrowed to Nissan Maxima (slightly more room) and TL because we felt most of the other contenders in this category would be too small. So far we're very pleased with our choice. Getting the kids in and out of the back is not as easy as in the van, but still not a problem. BTW they love the DVD surround sound in the Acura and fight over who gets next. I didn't drive the Infinity, d/t the perception it wasn't quite as big as the other 2. In the end, my advice is to figure out the way to get the best combination of practical (kids) and fun (mom and dad). Hope this helps.\", '1st, I agree with Wisngamecock that the TL & Nissan Maxima would probably do better with car seats than the G35 or VW Passat b/c of size. The Maxima is bigger than the TL, but you lose some handling.\\n\\nMore importantly, though, I\\'m concerned about your comment as follows:\\n\\n\"The TL has a latch position in the center, so you can place a rear-facing car seat in the middle and still have room for 2 adults on the outside positions.\"\\n\\nI have an \\'04 TL and use a car seat, as I did with my prior 2001.5 Passat, and I don\\'t think there is a center latch set in the Acura. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE count the number of latches. I believe you\\'ll find 4, and even though it is possible to attach the seat in the middle, you\\'ll be doing so using the inside passenger-side latch and the inside driver-side latch. Latches are not tested this way. They are intended to have pressure applied to the same set of latches. So please, make sure you find a car with 6 latches in the back if you want to latch in the center.', 'ljwalters1 -- Thanks for the comment about the number of latches. I was looking at the 05 TL and I am pretty sure there are 3 pairs of latches in the back. But I will reach in the back seat and count again. I should find a total of 6 latch connections. If not, then there goes the idea of placing the car seat in the middle.', \"I was fortunate enough to drive a 2005 g35 6mt for a few days and it was so interesting to me how I walked away from it. I was very strongly considering buying the car as a replacement to my 2003 330i as it is bigger and a little more family friendly. Here is my opinion.\\n\\n1. I know the g35 is faster on paper but it sure does not feel faster. I guess it has to do with the overall size of the car. But the BMW simply felt like it had more pop.\\n\\n2. I do admit the G has the bimmer beat in some areas. Back seat, stereo, and you can even argue it has a more modern look.\\n\\n3. But I am here to tell you that everything people say about BMW's is absolutely correct. The biggest difference for me was behind the wheel and the connection you have with your surroundings and the road. It is truly amazing to me.\\n\\nSo in conclusion I decided to stay in my 2003 330i and wait to see the 06 3-series.\\n\\nThe funniest thing to me was I walked away thinking that it is either a BMW or it is not. And I will look again in time at the g35 and the new lexus IS but in the end I believe that if I do not get a BMW I am going to load up a Honda Accord and be Mr. family guy.\\n\\nReally whats the difference, because if you want the best, get it.

But the BMW simply felt like it had more pop.\"\\n\\nWhen I drove the two cars back to back (auto), the G definitely felt faster. And that was with the 260hp 2003 G35. The 280hp 2005 G35 should be even faster.\\n\\nThe G is simply a bigger sedan than the 3. That alone works against it in terms of handling.', \"I am on the fence. I live in Chicago (weather and all) and am considering the RWD G35. Could someone tell me how it truly performs on wet/snowy climates, it would be appreciated.

I would consider the G35X, but the mileage issue and that it's just another thing to go wrong w/ the car has me concerned.\\n\\nThe Acura TL is my other option, but I am totally infatuated w/ the look and feel of the G35. Thanks.\", 'I have the same dilemma but have even more snow than you (we got 12\" Tues/Wed in South Bend when Chicago got maybe 1\").

A FWD car gets better traction b/c the engine sits over the wheels that drive, and that weight provides increased traction - probably due to increased friction with the road (don\\'t know if there are studies on that). TCS does not increase traction - it just makes the best use of whatever traction is there by increasing the drive power of whichever wheel has traction. It can\\'t create traction, which the fwd car does b/c of the engine placement. I would thing a fwd car would generally be better than rwd w/ TCS.', 'Well, are you talking about acceleration or handling (eg, not skidding) in incliment conditions?', 'Currently I have a RWD w/ TCS and Stability, a FWD w/out TCS, and an AWD w/out TCS. The RWD is still the worst of all my cars in poor road conditions.', \"Have you tried winter tires? I would have agreed with you until I bought a set for my current RWD car. Those tires (Michelin Arctic-Alpins) have transformed my car from the worst winter driver to the best I have ever had. Would an AWD equipped car shod with winter tires perform even better? In acceleration, almost certainly, however, given that my car is still more than capable until the snow rises above the door sills, I don't see any advantage to AWD considering the handling and braking disadvantages that come with the extra weight of the additional drivetrain hardware.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo\", 'KD- I know you and I have had some heated discussions in the past about BMW and Acura.\\nBut in all honesty, this car is the only car that has out right left me and my TLS in the dust.\\nSo I crossed enemy lines on Saturday just to get a taste of what this car feels like.\\n\\nI went to the local BMW dealer and test the 545- with the sport package.\\nI was blown away, this car is fast and I mean fast on every aspect of the rev-band.\\nIt was surprising to me that the dealer let me go on the test drive all by myself.I went there back in 99 when I was cross shopping the 3, TL and the Millennia and they wanted to put a traking device on the car\\n\\nAnyway, I think it is out of my price range but who knows, in few years I might buy one used.', \"No argument from me..

Traction is traction, whether it's off the line, cruising or in a turn, unless you want to work torque steer into the equation. I'm not a physicist, so I'm afraid we've reached the limits of my thinking!\", '\"Traction is traction, whether it\\'s off the line, cruising or in a turn...\"\\n\\nWell, no, not really. Static weight distribution (ie. front/rear weight bias) and driving dynamics play a substantial part in winter driving as well.\\n\\nThree examples (assuming two otherwise identical FWD and RWD cars driving in snowy conditions):\\n\\nAcceleration: under light acceleration (ie. very little front to rear weight transfer), the FWD car, with its ~60/40 weight distribution will have more traction than the RWD car with its ~50/50 weight distribution. However, under stronger acceleration, since weight transfers to the rear in such a situation, the front tires will lose traction whereas the RWD car will gain traction.\\n\\nAround a curve: the lighter back end of the FWD car will come unglued before the heavier front end of the car under some circumstances, while in others (accelerating through a curve for instance), since the front tires are being asked to do double duty (accelerating and turning), they will break loose (and plow) before the back end. A RWD car with a good traction control system will be less prone to either of those two scenarios.\\n\\nBraking: The FWD car, which already has a significant front end bias, will load up even more with the weight transfer of braking, allowing the back end to become very light and lose traction, and without the aid of TCS, could very well find said back end leading the front end down the road. The RWD car, given its better balance will be less susceptible to that situation as well.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', \"No, I haven't tried winter tires. But, to answer your second question, I have to extrapolate that, since my RWD car has the worst traction while NONE of my cars have winter tires, it would still have the worst traction if ALL of my cars had winter tires. It may no longer be dangerous, but it would still suffer by comparison.\\n\\nRegardless, I just don't want to spend the money and time, at this point, to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather. I kept my FWD car so that I can leave the RWD car at home when necessary.\\n\\nNow, let's keep in mind that not all Traction/Stability systems are created equal. I found the system in the Benz to be FAR more capable (and far more transparent) than the system in my 350Z. I'm confident that good tires on the Benz, with that system, would be much more suited to adverse weather than my Z with even some of the best tires.\", \"Fair enough. I must say that the TCS system on my 530i is quite impressive, and coupled with the additional winter tires (I ordered the Sport Package which includes summer tires), my car has gone from completely un-drivable in anything more than a dusting of snow to being able to easily plow through six inches as quickly as (if not quicker than) the ubiquitous SUVs that many here in southern New Hamster drive. Given that we are in the midst of our second one hundred inch or more winter in the last three seasons, I've had ample opportunity to drive with four to six inches on the roads.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo\", '\"Regardless, I just don\\'t want to spend the money and time, at this point, to buy special tires and change them depending on the weather.

Your former 330xi is a car that is running around with AWD hardware, and said hardware is both heavy and has a certain amount of mechanical drag associated with it. That makes the 330xi significantly slower and less responsive than a like equipped 330i. The CTS 3.6 has a RWD drive train which (like the 330i) is much more efficient, so no, it wasn't a fair comparison. To make it fair, you would need to compare it to a RWD 330i. As if the AWD components weren't enough of a handicap, the 330xi only comes equipped with (relatively) skinny All-Season tires, which are not at all conducive to good handling. IMHO it isn&#146;t even fair to compare a 330i SP to a 330xi, they just ain't the same.\\n\\nSince the lease is up on my 530i SP in a couple of weeks, and since I am going to hold off from getting a new car for a year or so, I've been taking the time to test drive virtually every thing out there, including a CTS 3.6 (automatic, no dealership around here stocks cars with manual transmissions, assuming of course that you can even order one these days). It was quick, however, not as quick as my 530i 5-Speed, which by the way is no match for a 330i 6-Speed. As for handling, sorry, the CTS felt like a land barge compared to my 530i, which once again, isn't in the same league as a 330i SP.\\n\\nRegarding trunk space; who cares? We are talking Performance Sedans here, and like it or not, trunk space is not something high on the priority list of most folks shopping for this type if car. Will the 330i hold three bags of golf clubs? Yes. Good enough!\\n\\nRegarding the pricing numbers you've been throwing around, me thinks you're playing it a little loose. I configured both cars as follows (which is how I would order them were I going to do so today):\\n\\nCadillac CTS Luxury Sport: $41,385\\nBMW 330i, PP, SP, Xenon, Heated Front Seats: $40,995\\n\\nThe only option that the CTS has that the 330i doesn't have is the UGO, which is an after market accessory costing $145. In the end, those two cars are as Apples to Apples as it gets, and the BMW costs a whopping $245 less. Sorry, I cannot get too excited about the price difference. What I can get excited about is the difference in how they DRIVE (note, not just how they accelerate), and in that comparison, the Cadillac finished a very distant second.\\n\\nEnjoy your CTS.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo\", 'LOL.

Or if BMW will confirm a 130, then get a simple convertible for a year or two and the 130 will join it eventually.\", \"About your new car considerations- If you want an A3, you may have to wait like half a year for the 3.2 version, which is the one that would really have you pick it over the Mazda in performance. The 2.0T just isn't powerful enough to compete with that. Also, the 3.2 is supposed to have the DSG transmission from the TT 3.2, but neither A3s are supposed to have quattro until next year. And, BMW isn't giving us the 1 Series. The 1 Series is the Europe and Asia-only hatch. America is getting the 2 Series, a tiny coupe and convertible model. But, you're not going to be able to get it until like 2008. It's still developing. About the A3 again, if you want your car soon, and have the $, maybe you could spring for the S4 Avant instead, and have more performance, luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag. This is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. Or, if you can't afford that, look at the A4 Avant or Sedan 3.2. It's supposed to really fly! Anyway, BMW already did confirm a 130i, and it's already on sale in other parts of the world. It's the 230i you want.\\n\\nAlso, I don't know how long you can wait, but the next TT is supposed to be a major rocket. It's going to have an Audi Alluminum Space Frame, and it's going to also have the next generation Audi/Volkswagen V6: A 3.6 V6, first being used in the upcoming Passat, is going to generate some 280 horses, and that's not all. Audi is going to make a TTS, supposedly with the 340 horsepower V8 from the S4 (If it can fit), and a TT RS, but I don't know what that monster is gonna have. It should give the Porsche Boxster S and the Mercedes SLK 55 AMG a major heads-up. Or, they'll eat its dust if they don't put the 911 engine in the Boxster and make an SLK 63 AMG!\", \"The 2.0T just isn't powerful enough to compete with that. Also, the 3.2 is supposed to have the DSG transmission\\n\\nUh, the DSG is going in the 2.0 also. DSG is already available in europe on the A3 and GTI: http://www.tiscali.co.uk/motoring/roadtests/whatcar/audi/a3hatchback/210359/full.html\\n\\nAnd, BMW isn't giving us the 1 Series. The 1 Series is the Europe and Asia-only hatch.\\n\\nThe 1 series is in Mexico right now...Mexico's not in Asia or Europe last time I checked. In fact last weekend a friend saw a 1 series at Fashion Valley Mall here in San Diego. It had Baja Mex plates on it.\\n\\nSo you might want to amend that statement.\\n\\nA3 again, if you want your car soon, and have the $, maybe you could spring for the S4 Avant instead, and have more performance, luxury and equal style for a bigger price tag\\n\\nS4 Avant = big fat, lazy pig. That thing weighs nearly 2 tons (3957 to be exact)! If i wanted something fast I'd just keep my 330i ZHP. The 2.0 is under 30k nicely optioned and it gets 31 mpg v. 21 mpg. Take the extra 20k and go buy a used Miata and mod it to the high heavens.\\n.\\n. This is because that the 3.2 isn't coming soon. Or, if you can't afford that, look at the A4 Avant or Sedan 3.2. It's supposed to really fly! Anyway, BMW already did confirm a 130i, and it's already on sale in other parts of the world. It's the 230i you want.\\n\\n\\nSpend some time on Bimmer boards. The success of the Mazda3 and possible success of the A3 will most likely mean the invasion of Bavaria's smallest soldier. If the A3 flops, BMW won't bother.\", '\"Also, I don\\'t know how long you can wait, but the next TT is supposed to be a major rocket.

I\\'m sorry, that\\'s not correct!\\n\\nAudi and VW are not using the same engine. Audi is wedded to a true V6 as it is shorter and is able to be mounted longitudinally and still allow for a nice installation for AWD. VW is reverting back to a VR6 design for the new Passat, with is a longer mill, requiring a transverse installation and an AWD system similar in nature to what the Audi TT has sported for a few years.\\n\\nGiven the numerous inaccuracies in you post, I find myself wondering where you got your information.

I drive about 50 miles a day.\\n\\nI thought for a while that I would like the G35(6MT), but after driving one for almost a day I was not a fan with the way the car set up. The interior had maxima written all over it (to be honest, it is the interior they should\\'ve put in the maxima). The performance was strong and obviously fast but it did not possess the crisp feeling of my 330i. So the G35 became an after thought. (I will speak more on it later)\\n\\nSo now it is going to come down to the TL v BMW.\\n\\nI had the honor of taking out the new 06 325i (6-MT) yesterday and a tip of the hat to everyone waiting for one. I know what the horsepower says, and I can read the 0-60 times but I say without hesitation that the new 325i absolutely rips the G35 and TL apart. It feels as fast as my present 330i and the driving experience is actually improved. It is truly another typical BMW \"how do they do that?\" experiences. And after driving the 3 cars, anyone who says the G35 or TL is close to the 325i is saying that because that is what they have in their garage. I am coming at you honestly b/c I am leaning towards the TL, but the fun factor of driving the 325i is not even measurable. It truly is a 4-door sports car. The sales person asked if I wanted to take the 330i out and I said no. Reason being is, if I do, I know I will regret not getting one every day I drive something else. the other big positive, is the new stereo is \"ABOUT TIME\". The HK\\'s in BMW\\'s are flat out garbage and have no business being in such a car. The new logic 7 sounded awesome for the little time I used it.\\n\\nHOWEVER,\\n\\nThe feeling from the drivers seat is tight. Both in a good way, and a bad way. It is a fully connected driving experience but it still feels small. A cruising machine this is not. Now the real bad. There is no noticeable difference in back seat room. I am 6\\' tall and I would want no part of sitting behind me. Also a very big flaw, it getting in the passenger seat. I must have looked funny as I got in and out several times, and each time I hit my left knee on the dash which is now bowed out rather than in. I can hear my wife now saying how much she \"hates getting in and out of that THING!\". I like the look, but I just feel from the outside the TL looks more aggressive. Something about the lower rockers that make it look more aggressive. I like the front and the back does not bother me but I bet that when the M3 hits we all say, wow thats they way they all should look. Much like the 5 series and M5.\\n\\nthat brings me to the TL and away from the G35. Since I feel (and you will too if you ever drive the new bimmers) that there is NOTHING like them, it does not make a difference what else you get, it is not the best. So other factors then come into play. The total size and interior of the TL I find gorgeous, not to mention they have every toy in the book. The germans make engines and the Japanese make technology. The Nav system and stereos on the TL are as you know, simply the best around. The seats are big and comfortable. And the back seat is perfect for a father of one who is getting bigger every day. I live in the northeast and front wheel drive also has advantages. Simply put the TL is a fast, and very nice touring sedan that is perfect for a commute.\\n\\nI still need to give things a little thought. I really would love the BMW but I think the TL is a better fit for my life in 2005. I am going to be very jealous though every time I see a 330i screeming around some turn and the driver smiling from ear to ear.\\n\\nI hope you liked my take.....\\n\\ndjocks', \"Pick up the TL for your everyday family/commute requirements.

I have a TL and didn't bother looking at the BMWs b/c I needed a larger car, too. It would've had to be a 5-series, and there's no way I could afford it.\\n\\nAnyway, I love my '04 6MT TL w/Nav, and don't understand other posters' comments re turns. The TL handles great - nice and tight, yet very comfortable. The only negative is torque steer. In fact, while I'm sure BMW are faster, my TL gives me more power than I can use. Great acceleration, great handling, great features, etc. Only problem is the torque steer.\", 'I test drove the 05TL, 05 G35 and 05 3 series. I totally disagree with the aforementioned assessment, as I opted for the G35 sedan. I added the sport suspension with 18inch rims and the handling is right in the 3 series\\' league. The RWD drive is the number one attribute to a real performance car and that eliminated the TL. In addition, the TL & 3 series doesn\\'t have the \"umfff\" factor that the G has. The power and acceleration is head snapping. Infiniti put there dollars into the performance...', \"...it is a very good value and I felt that it would make an excellent high-speed cruiser. But the car just didn't feel good or dialed in when going through curves... at least as compared to the 330i I drove or even my under-powered Audi A4 with the itty-bitty 1.8 turbo (Quattro). I admit that this is solely my subjective impression as the test data that I have read in car mags indicate that the TL does generate good handling numbers. But the communication just doesn't seem to be there. The TL I drove really didn't like fast, tight turns. Might just have been that the tires weren't at a proper pressure. But can't argue with the TL pricing... the car is a nice deal, especially compared to the 330i. But between the two I'd shell out the extra $$$ for the bimmer (but I guess I better give the G35 a look).\\n\\nByron\", 'I would look at the 5 series more also if it were not out of my budget.\\n\\nI am going to drive the TL again on Tuesday but the first time I thought it drove very nice.

Torque steer aint gonna bother my none on the merrit pkwy in CT and it just those times when you really feel like having fun that you will see the difference.\\n\\nI can not get over how BMW improved so much on what was already the best driving experience in the class.

They both excel (excuse the pun) in the performance department. But, IMHO, they are a little shy in the size, comfort, and luxury area.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a mix of good (albeit not top notch) performance with luxury, the TL is hard to beat, especially at several thousand less than the comparably equipped BMW and G35.\\n\\nI test-drove all 3 (&#145;05 BMW, not &#146;06).

At first glance the M35 is priced near 50k as seen on most dealer lots, but I soon realized that was with their \"sport\" edition.

They\\'re both in that 270-280 HP range. I ended up making my decision on interior features and \"uniqueness\". One key factor was road noise - this was a hands down winner for the M35. As a frequent L.A. freeway driver, and as someone that often has passengers, this was important.

I grew up driving rear drive vehicles and I just prefer them. THe wife drives a Saab 9-3 Aero convertible and it's a great machine but the torque steer, while minimized, is still annoying.

I think the G35 is taller and narrower and has a bit more rear-seat leg room than the TL. But the rear-seat head-room on the TL I found much better. I know you can recline the G's back seat, but I found it to be uncomfortable when reclined.\\n\\nAs far as space is concerned, the TL felt wider (roomier), more like a Grand Prix compared to the G35 which I felt was similar to a Grand Am.

We've got side door sill pockets that expand; a bi-level center console that's so deep they added a light to it; rear seatbacks; a little flip-out drawer in the back of the center console; closable/concealable cupholders; 2 drawers in the center-stack (maybe more if you don't have nav); and a decent-sized glove box.

Doesn't matter if I got a G35 or 330i, i'd still be plunking down for new tires every 13-15k miles of driving.\\n\\nThe people I know with G35s have had to pay for oil changes, services (some as little as $100 and others over $500 for 15k mile check and 30k mile check up). Getting an oil change every 7.5k with synthetic will run you at least $50. So even going low, a G35 by 30k miles will cost at minimum (not including tires) $400. My BMW = 0.\\n\\nbut what about outside warranty? Average buyers in this bracket don't own more than 3-4 years. I leased my 330i expressly so I'd never own it out of warranty. In other words by 45k miles I will have bought tires for my car. Has it had problems in the first 30k miles? Yep. They haven't cost me one cent. So I really don't care if the car breaks down. It goes to the shop and gets fixed. No big deal.

With auto transmission, it was also the dog of the group.\\n\\nFinally, I was most impressed with the G35. It was the Sports Car of the bunch. It had the most powerful acceleration and strongest feeling motor, and the suspension was firm (just right for me). It's remarkable that a car this large and heavy can feel so light and tossable. Body motions were well controlled, and the car was easy to steer with throttle. I do know, however, from a not-too-recent test drive that it's freeway ride is the harshest of the bunch. It's interior, though improved last year, still strikes me as cheap and contrived.\\n\\nIf I had to choose one as a daily driver, I'd have to take th middle road and say the BMW has the best compromise of the group.

That line of bilge has been repeated so often that to some at least, it has become fact. Sorry, but I have never seen any evidence, scientific, anecdotal or otherwise to support such a claim. The simple truth is that cars, ALL cars, are far more reliable now then they have been at anytime in history, and BMWs are some of the most reliable.\\n\\nAhhh, buy the naysayers will say, \"Oh yeah! Well just look at the statistics referenced in the above post. You\\'ll see that Toyota has 196/PP100 vs. BMWs 262/PP100 rating.\"\\n\\nUh-huh, well personally both numbers look pretty damn good to me, and furthermore, comparing the full North American BMW line (all fairly complex performance/luxury cars) to the full line of Toyotas (starting with no/low option strppo econo-boxes with far fewer components to fail) seems to be a bit disingenuous if you ask me. To my way of thinking at least, a much more fair comparison would be Lexus vs. BMW, and while I haven\\'t seen those numbers in a while, if memory serves, the gap was much narrower. Even still, the report shows that for every four problems reported by a Toyota owner, a BMW owner will report roughly five. So much for being &#147;unreliable&#148;. I did find it interesting to note that BMW and a few other European manufacturers were singled out in the following quote: &#147;Porsche, Jaguar, Saab and BMW perform well above the industry average in dependability\\x85&#148; as being quite reliable.\\n\\nAnother knock that I continually read about BMWs is that they cost a lot of money to maintain. That too is pure fabrication. The only out of pocket expense a late model BMW owner should experience for the first 50,000 miles is tires. Period, full stop, the end. Everything else is covered under the full maintenance program. Once a car has enough miles and/or years to no longer be covered under the maintenance program, they seem pretty reasonable to maintain, especially given their very long service intervals called for in the Owner\\'s Manual. Basically, change the oil every year or 15,000 miles, change the brake fluid every two years and the coolant every three or four years (IIRC). As for the scheduled \"Services\", those occur every 30,000 miles, and while the cost can range from $600 to over $1,000, when you consider the number of miles that cost gets amortized over, it just ain\\'t that much money.\\n\\nSaid another way, my bet is that if you were to do an \"Apples to Apples\" comparison of a new E90 3-Series vs. a new second generation Lexus IS, my bet is that the BMW will cost less money for general maintenance and repair than the Lexus for at least the first 100,000 miles. How much less? Probably not too much, but less is still less.\\n\\nMe personally, I\\'m waiting to drive the IS and the E90 back to back, and I\\'ll go with the one I like the best. Their relative reliability and the cost of maintenance is, in my mind at least, not a defining issue.\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', \"When you fork out 1000's more, one thing you would expect is more reliability.

I think it cost me something like $275.00, I forget.\\n\\nI'm sorry, but it would be disingenuous for me to confess to reliability problems I haven't had. I'm not saying that BMW's are problem free (no car is), it's just that reliability ratings can be misleading.

Even with such high horsepower, the car was largely devoid of torque steer, a tendency for the front wheels to briefly pull the vehicle off its intended line under strong acceleration (common in front-wheel-drive cars). The engine is coupled with a smooth and responsive five-speed automatic transmission.

I was just thinking that if she drove a TL, I think she would be impressed.', 'An 04 TL is nearly two model years old. 06s are two months away...so 24-30k miles is normal.', \"I'll have to weigh in on the side of the TL - here's some general comments (no particular order), and I include a little scoring system (+1 for 1st, 0 for 2nd, -1 for 3rd) that's really just for my own fun.:\\n\\n1. RIDE QUALITY. As far as ride quality, I'd guess you prefer a cushier, luxurious ride to a sporty, tight ride. The used GS430 your considering would probably have the best ride, but with all the high-tech features you want, the TL would probably be a good compromise between comfort, price and features. The G35 has the most sporty, probably least forgiving ride of the 3. (GS 1; TL 0; G35 -1)\\n\\n2. STATUS. I think Acura has the least status among Lexus, Infiniti and Acura. I think Lexus is #1 of those 3, so the GS has it here, too. (GS 2; TL -1; G35 -1)\\n\\n3. FEATURES. The used GS isn't going to be the most technologically advanced. Of the 3 cars you might be considering, the TL has it hands down, with all the features you mentioned except for traffic navigation (only in the RL & maybe the Infiniti M) and a video player. You'll also have to say goodbye to rain-sensing wipers (something I sorely miss from my last car). The voice-recognition of the TL's nav and its integration with climate control and the radio is utterly amazing!!! I cannot understate this (you can be driving and just verbally tell the car to change the temp, pass temp only, direct air through particular vents, etc. You can scroll through your presets, and when there's nothing on the radio, direct the cd player to play any particular track on any particular disc - it's awesome!!!!). As an aside, the Infiniti M, which is out of your price range and might be too rough a ride, has the best technological features of any car I know. If it came with a manual transmission, it'd be my dream car. Another bonus to the TLs nav is that it's a touch-screen, which makes entering info manually much easier than otherwise, and you can enter info while in motion. My parents Lexus does not allow this. I don't know about the G35s nav, but, in general, I think the G35 is the least technically advanced of the 3, but a new G would have it over an onlder Lexus, I think. (GS 1; TL 0; G35 -1)\\n\\nPRICE. I'm not checking the classifieds for you, but I know that to get all the tech features you want, it'll add much more to the GS, since it'll probably need to be aftermarket, if it can be done at all, and it'll cost the least extra on the TL b/c it's all included, except the nav, which is pretty common. Depending on the changes made on the '06 models, you might be willing to save even more $$$ by buying a used TL or G35. (GS 0; TL 1; G35 -1)\\n\\nAnyway, my scoring has the TL ontop (no surprise - it's what I drive), but disregarding the scoring for a sec, you need to discount the BMW & G35 b/c they value sportiness over luxury, and you seem to prefer luxury. The GS has it in luxurious ride and prestige; the TL has it in technology. I think your choice comes down to those two, and will depend on which you value more.\\n\\nPS - I think a guy will be more impressed by a TL than a GS. As a single gal, that might play into things a bit.\", 'The past two season Bill Auberlin won the Touring car national championship in a BMW 325.

I think all will agree to the prices paid as demonstrated on the board postings on this web site. The $37k is fact.\\n\\nAs for the price of the G35 sedan...I did not specifically get a pricing. However I understand that it is roughly about $35.5k. I believe compared to the TL w/nav of $32.2k which was demonstrated by 'laydi' email quote from the dealer.\\n\\nSecond paragraph. Yes...I did not bargain further on the G35 as I disclosed in my initial note. However...once again...the pricing I provided is pricing paid by others on the board...after negotiations. Please refer to the messages on the board which I referred to...those are actual paid prices ($37k for a G35 6mt coupe). I did not make them up. $37k...fact once again.\\n\\nSo let me summarize. Most think of the G35 as a coupe. The G35 6mt coupe with Nav is selling for $37k according to multiple postings on this web site's board. The G35 sedan is approximately $35.5k. These prices compares to Acura TL which is being initially quoted to a prospective buyer at $32.5k...with a likely purchase price of ~$32k after negotiations.\\n\\nAll in all...forget the discussion of the pricing. Look towards my initial email today which goes over the various amentities of the TL...and how it addresses 'laydi' initial email which communicates her wants and desires in a car....she wants the world. The TL should be considered.\", \"Yours is apples and oranges as Carsdirect is not what is the going rate and not certain if it even includes destination charges....as once again...look at what people have been paying on the boards here.\\n\\nYou're right...any person with decent negotiating skills should be buying lower than carsdirect.com's price.\\n\\nI am not making it up...just look at the prices paid on the boards. Re-read my message #3902 and you will see.\\n\\nThose people aren't very good at what they're doing. The G35 6mt with navi, xm, premium and splash guards (what blazes is that?) is listed for 33k on carsdirect.com. I'd expect any infinit dealer would beat that by $200-500.\\n\\nThere's a $2000 manufacturer to dealer incentive on the G35. That means, get the price to $200 over invoice (what one should pay for a car this old) and then subtract another $2k from the price. that's the target. of course 200-500 is more realistic.\\n\\nAnd if you can't get a dealer to let you in on the $2k, that dealer isn't worth going to.\", \"First...most likely than not...when people think of G35..they think of the coupe\\n\\nFirst, you're on a SEDAN board so when comparing the TL to the G35 we're talking sedan to sedan.

The car was only $10k more than a V-6 Accord and less than $5k more than either the TL or the G35. To me - worth it. Still, the smaller engined 325i outsold the 330i by 6 to 1, so price does make a difference, even for the average BMW consumer.\\n\\nI really like the TL - a very nice car - good-looking, fast, comfortable, a beautiful interior, and all the high tech done right.\\nI also like the G35, particularly with a manual transmission. It has \"V-8 like\" power and good brakes. The automatic transmission is the weakest link in the G35 sedan.\\n\\nI think the GS300 and 430 are in another class all together and compete against the 5 series BMW and the Acura RL. The Lexus equivalent is the updated IS250 and 350. I\\'m still waiting to check those two out. The old IS handled fine, but was a bit gaudy for my taste.\\n\\nI still think the TL is the one for the lady, as it nicely bridges the gap between her soft, luxurious ES300 and the G35. A little more sport than what she drove before, but not the whole hog of the G35.', '\"The G \"Base\" sedan has no amentities and is not comparable. Need to upgrade with the premium package and sports suspension package.\"\\n\\nOk I really do not like flame wars, but since some people may actually use these forums to make a car buying decision I feel like I should disagree with this statement.\\n\\nThe G base actually has a lot of features. Power leather heated seats six cd in dash changer with mp3, adjutsable wheel with telescoping, adjustable rear seats, power window and mirrors, side and curtain airbags, xenon lights etc. Not as much features as the accord of course but enough that you are not really missing anything. And as such it is 2k cheaper than the base acord. If you insist that the premium package is necessary for comparison then the g35 is about 1.5 k more expensive.\\n\\nAnd no the G35 does not need the performance package to compare with a base accord. The G35 multilink suspension is more advanced than the acura double wishbone one. Also the G35 uses aluminum in its suspension elements I am not sure if the acura does (they dont mention it, which probably means they use steel). In any event the g35 will handle better even if you do not consider the acura\\'s fwd. And the problems with the fwd have already been beaten to death in these forums. So in conclusion a standard suspension g35 will handle better than the standard TL suspension.\\n\\nOn top of everything else if you get the manual tranny you get the performance package standard as well. So then you have to add the 18 inch wheels to the tl in order to make it comparable. So the G35 with the premium package will be about the same price as a comparable tl with the 18 inch wheels. I cannot give exact numbers here because the 18 inch wheels on the TL require unspecified dealership installation charges.\\n\\nSo in summary:\\ng35 auto vs TL auto = TL is 1.5 k cheaper\\ng35 manual vs TL manual = about the same price\\n\\nIn these packages the TL has some more features and better interior while the G35 has more powerful engine and better handling. There you go.', \"I am getting out of this discussion.

I love the early clutch engagement and it shifts very smoothely.\\n\\nAs far as luxury features that I use, it\\'s pretty close. The TLs nav makes it much, much better than the Passat, IMO. But if you\\'re comparing non-nav vehicles, other than a 6-disc changer, I\\'m not sure what luxury features the TL has that the Passat doesn\\'t. One is that the TLs lights shut-off automatically. Also, I like that the TL doesn\\'t have a loud \"ding\" to let you know you\\'re low on fuel. I\\'d often find myself driving where the tank is just at the cutoff level and the light would go on and off, dinging each time. I also like the TLs auto-a/c better. For some reason, the Passat\\'s would always be 1 level too strong for me. The 1 thing that drove me crazy about the Passat was the steering wheel radio controls. The buttons should be on the left and the station changer should scroll the presets - VW got it backwards.\\n\\nHere are some things I miss from the Passat: the key integrated fob (TL uses a separate FOB and regular key); electric fold-in mirrors; rear sunshade; rain-sensing wipers. Also, the Passat had nicer computer controls b/c (1) there were 2 sets of settings (TL has 1); (2) you didn\\'t need to take your hand off the wheel to scroll through the options; (3) the Passat gave you more info on each screen; (4) the TL makes you hit a \"display\" button to display mpg, ave mph, etc.\\n\\nAs far as differences that aren\\'t good or bad, the Passat\\'s seats are more firm, the TL\\'s are softer.\\n\\nFrankly, from what I\\'v heard of the \\'06 Passat, it might be a tough deciding between the 2, but I\\'d expect the TL to give you a better value b/c Passats will probably go for MSRP initially.\\n\\nTo sum up, if you have a top-of-the-line Passat and enjoy it, but want something a tad more luxurious and a lot more sporty, you\\'ll love the TL.

In my experience the coupes have almost no chasis flex. This is because the FM platform is really solid, and the coupe bodystyle further reverses flex. You can read reviews of the g35 and the 350z (which has the fm platform as well) and most of them, even one review that slammed the 350z say that the FM platform was great and allowed no chasis flex or squirm. As I said that has been my experience as well, especially now that I am driving the car in the pothole filled streets of LA I find that the chasis does not twist and squirm even when i hit the big potholes.\\n\\nIt is possible that the car you drove had something disconnected or lose that made noise, which sounded like chasis flex.\\n\\nThe problem is that the FM platform is made out of steel, so it makes the car comparatively heavy. It is not that heavy compared to other cars of its class, but it is a pig compared to small sports cars, i.e. s2000s and miatas. The G35 would so much better if its body was made of aluminum but I am sure that would make it much more expensive too.\\n\\n\"And in the G35c outward vision is compromised too much.\"\\n\\nThat is only true in the back. And you can get good vision in the back if you are very careful about setting up your side mirrors. But I admit, this car definately needs bigger mirrors.\\n\\n\"perfect comfort, poise, power, handling, reliability.\"\\n\\nFor me the G has everything sans the comfort.

The conversation on the BMW3 vs. G35 is interesting, but really I think the two cars serve (slightly) different targets.

But if you asked me if i made the logical and practical decision at the time - I would say yes, of course. From what I gather from the many happy G owners on this board, Infinti does, in most cases, provide a great handling, midsize car for a good sum of $ less than BMW's 3 series. If I hadn't had my sour experience with Infiniti, and I were in the market for a sport sedan - and money was a consideration (as it is for most of us) the G would definently be on my shopping list. The higher price of the 3 series does pose a problem for some buyers in this category, and at any rate, the G provides more interior room than even the new 3. I agree with you that these two cars are serving different targets, but those targets aren't too far apart. I did spend 35,000 miles behind the wheel of my G before it was gone. I have spent about 4k miles in my new 3 and the cars each have their strengths - along with very few weaknesses. I will give you guys/gals my honest opinion of each car (I'll pretend for fairness sake that nothing was wrong with my G)\\n\\nThe G was very quick with it's 260 hp and torque. The car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match BMW for handling at high speeds (90+). the BMW seems more at home the harder you push it while the Infiniti feels like it's up to the task, but it does it with a straight face while the BMW does it with a smile. The BMW has the better interior hands down, quality wise, I wont comment on style because that very objective. The BMW is a tigher squeeze though, and most taller passengers will be asking the driver and font passenger to move up. It seems once you get situated in the BMW, no one complains from lack of space. The Infinti's rear doors open much much wider than the bimmers, though - and the seats also recline in the G. The engines are a tossup, I think the inline 6 is smoother than the v6 in the infiniti but i will agree that infiniti's v6 is probably the second best engine I have ever owned. The transmission in the BMW has an extra gear and seems to shift smoother and quicker. I had a full size spare in my G and I loved it. I don't like the new run flats on my 3. I prefer the BMWs brakes though. BMW does include maintenance, which is nice- but not a deal maker in any respect.\\n\\nThey are both great performers and I think anywho who choses either is getting one of the best sport sedans available in this class.\", \"The car handled well at nearly all speeds but doesn't match BMW for handling at high speeds (90+).\\n\\nUnless you are in Montana, you are not supposed to be going 90+ :P\", 'With the G35 you get better straight-line performance, more interior room,\\nand about $7000 left over.\\n\\nYes, but u also have to look @ a butt ugly car everyday.\\nBMW Badge is worth the extra $7,000.00', \"The G sedan is not to my taste, but I wouldn't call it butt ugly.

An e90 cannot even approach these numbers. And that is an auto tranny IS350 going against a 6MT 330i. Just imagine the IS with a 6MT ??????

No leather, no xenons, no moonroof. IS350 would probably be 34-36k (we'll know soon). As far as I can tell, to get xenon lights on the IS350 you must get the 3rd highest package and a moonroof is still an option. We know the cars will come with this stuff on lots so it's safe to say an IS350's gonna run over 38k msrp. I'm betting (given GS pricing differences between the 6 and 8) that the IS350 will start at 36-37k (just like the 330i). So I'm not expecting the IS350 to be less than a 330i.\\n\\nWhere's the value?

Since I now know that I\\'m not a driver (just a passenger) I decided to read the Wall St. Journal on the way to work, rather than pay attention to the road, steer, brake, accelerate or play with my TLs autostick. Well, after getting the car going in the right direction (weird, I was in the driver\\'s seat and it seemed if I didn\\'t use the steering wheel, accelerator and gear selector, the car wouldn\\'t move!) I whipped out the WSJ and began reading. As my TL approached the 90 degree left turn on my street, the TL didn\\'t turn!!! It went straight into my neighbor\\'s yard! As if there was no driver! Funny, though. Every other morning, when I\\'m \"not driving\" the TL responds to my decisions and inputs using all the controls provided to \"drive\" the car. I\\'m so confused, could it be that manual or automatic or semi-automatic or some variation, we really are all drivers? :confuse:\\n\\nActually, I do understand what you \"Live Manual or Die\" guys are talking about. I\\'m just having some Internet fun... Well, I think it\\'s fun...\\n\\nFor the first 15 years of my driving life, I was a die-hard 5 speed manual guy (Saab 99, VW Scirocco, Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo, Acura Integra). And then came the fateful day I was promoted into sales and inherited the Sales Manger\\'s Olds (at 11,000 miles the gas tank ruptured a seam on the TOP of the tank!) and for the next 5 years, boring but servicable domestic, automatic sedans. I did however, teach the evil wife to drive a stick and bought her a Nissan Sentra SE - R (fun, fun, fun) followed by a Saab 900s (fun, very practical. My attempt to avoid an SUV or Minivan) as the family began to grow. These were mine to play with on the weekend. I \"retired\" (downsized ) from the sales game and bought my company Dodge Intrepid (nice car but very loud and not Honda build quality. But reliable and good looking, good in snow). I believed I would return to the land of the \"driver\" soon.\\n\\nOnce I began my second career, it was time for a new car. As I was now a commuter, evil wife suggested I drive the Saab for a month of commuting to ensure I wanted a stick. I was sure the commute wouldn\\'t sway me away, I was wrong. It was just no fun shifting between 1-2-3 every 17 seconds, rarely getting above 40mph. After a week, I returned the Saab, bought a Chrysler 300M ( I can\\'t believe I bought a first model year, domestic CHRYSLER! I broke every rule there!) and had a plan. The wife\\'s next car would be a 5 speed (Saab 9-5 or maybe A4 Avant, possibly a BMW 3 wagon? I was looking forward to shopping for her) and I would continue my tradition of enjoying row your own boat driving on the weekend. Ah, but as is often the folly that is my grand planning, the wife said she was done with manuals, she commutes too and driving to her is just a necessary evil. Hence, the Saab turned into (what else?) a Lexus RX 300 as our family grew again. She\\'s very happy, therefore I\\'m very happy.\\n\\nWill there be a manual tranny again in my future? Who knows.

Has nothing to do with qulifications or superiority!\", \"Here's a good breakdown on how the DSG works:\\n\\nhttp://www.canadiandriver.com/articles/jk/031119.htm\\n\\nInside the computer controlled gearbox there are four shafts: two input shafts and two output shafts. The input shafts are concentric, with one shaft passing through the centre of the other hollow input shaft. There are two multi-plate clutch packs similar to those found in automatic transmissions. Each clutch pack connects one of the input shafts to the engine, so depending upon which is applied, either one of the two input shafts can transfer power. An oil pump at the rear of the gearbox supplies hydraulic pressure for the clutches.\\n\\nThe speed gears are divided between the two output shafts. First, third, fifth and reverse gear are on one output shaft while second, fourth and sixth gears are on the other shaft. Synchronisers are moved by the computer to lock each of the speed gears to their output shaft as required. Each output shaft has a pinion gear that drives the differential.\\n\\nWhen the driver places the shift lever in drive, First gear is engaged inside the transmission, but the clutch doesn't engage until the driver steps on the gas. Because the clutch is running in oil, it can slip without burning up, allowing the car to creep along in first gear just as an automatic would. Step harder on the gas and the clutch is fully applied. A neat feature of the control system allows the driver to step on the gas and brake at the same time. Audi calls it Launch Control and it allows F1-type starts. In Sport mode with both pedals pressed, the engine revs to 3200 rpm. Release the brake and the car launches in drag strip fashion.\\n\\nWith the transmission engaged in first gear, the computer locks second gear to the other output shaft, but the input shaft clutch for that gear is not engaged. When it is time to shift, the computer releases the clutch for the first gear input and engages the clutch for the second gear input. In preparation for the next shift, the computer now shifts from first to third gear but leaves its clutch disengaged until the shift is requested. As the car's speed increases, the computer continues to pre-select the next gear so all it has to do is switch clutches. There is no grinding, no delays, and no shock.\\n\\nBy monitoring driving style, the computer predicts whether the driver will request an upshift or downshift next so it can pre-select the correct gear. It is possible to fool the computer by driving erratically, but even if the wrong gear is pre-selected it only takes a fraction of a second for it to catch up. This transmission shifts fast, with shift times in the .03 to .04 second range. Even an excellent driver has trouble matching that consistently, and this transmission can do it all day long.\", '\"It\\'s an automatic clutch; this makes them automatics. Call it a semi-automatic or whatever you want, but it\\'s still an automatic and nothing like a true manual transmission where the driver is an actual part of the drive train.\"\\n\\nIf you\\'re definition of automatic is computer controled clutch, then SMG, DSG, etc are automatics.\\n\\nYou\\'re the first I know of who defines automatic that way, since majority of people & most automotive mags define automatic as having a torque converter and manual as having a clutch.', 'Folks, this is a matter about which everyone is entitled to choose.

The Germans loses almost every time if either objective measures is held constant for comparison: TL and G beats 5, E and A6 on handling quite easily if size is the criterium for \"comparable.\" TL and G beat 325, C230 and A4 1.8/2.0 handily if price is the criterium for \"comparable.\". It is only when one relaxes standards and bias the \"comparable\" in favor of the Germans that they would win compros; any wonder in the rigged result? If you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling unless the mfr is utterly incompetent.', 'If you are willing to spend moreny more on a smaller car with less luxury, chances are indeed good that you will get better handling\\n\\nAs long as the size of the car is big enough for the target market, it doesn\\'t matter that the E90 is smaller than the IS, they\\'re both big enough. Personally, I think the G35 is too big - more of a mid-size car pretending (very well, mind you) to be compact.\\n\\nLuxury is more than just feature content. Luxury, in large part, is qualified by the \"feel\" of an automobile. How refined is the drivetrain? How quiet is the interior? How solid is the body structure? How well does the suspension absorb impacts and/or transmit them to the cockpit? How do the doors feel/sound when you shut them? What do the plastics look/feel like? How smoothly do the controls operate?\\n\\nAn E90 with vinyl seats and halogen headlights may be lacking some features one expects to have in an \"entry-level luxury\" car, but it is definitely a luxurious where it really matters.\\n\\nIt really boils down to individual priorities. Size, amenities, handling, acceleration, refinement. All of these cars offer a different mix of them.', \"Here's the thing though, the Japanese mfrs are theoretically just as competent to make a great performing small or medium sized sedan as the Germans are. So why do they not make direct competition for the Germans. As you said, the 3 series is quite a bit smaller than the TL, G, ES (I can't believe you even mentioned the ES - what car has that thing ever out performed?). So, why not compete directly with them? The TSX is similar in size to the 3 series, but Acura gives it a relatively weak engine, makes it FWD and what do you expect, it doesn't compete. With regard to the TL and G which 5, E or A6 will they beat with regards to performance? That's another (IMO) problem with Japanese mfrs - they give you limited choices. You can get an A6 3.2, A6 4.2, S6 (soon) or RS6 (in a few years), and similar options exist with BMW and MB. Will the TL out perform all of them? Obviously not. You don't have to be that biased (or at all) to see that in regards to handling/performance (and I don't just mean straight line) German cars generally out perform comparable Japanese cars - IMHO of course ) Don't take this as a personal assault. I like Japanese cars, and would readily buy one, but it has to perform, and in the cars I've compared they generally haven't kept up.\", 'A bewildered Lexus salesman watched as I adjusted the front seat on the IS250 to my liking and then hopped in the back to take photos.\\n\\nSome on Edmunds forums are saying a 6 foot man fits just fine in the back of the new IS.

There is another factor that may or may not be present in the two versions of the G35 (but is definitely a factor with the likes of the E60 and E90 BMWs). Some manufacturers, BMW for instance, only offer a true Sport Package (stiffer/lower suspension and better rubber and wheels) on the RWD models. While this situation is not really part of the AWD vs. RWD debate per-se, it is a very real world factor to be dealt with. The standard suspension setup that comes on the AWD BMWs, while still competent, is no match for the ones that come on the RWD SP equipped models. Rain, sleet, ice, snow or dry, the better handling suspension is still the better handling suspension. To my way of thinking, an SP equipped RWD BMW will handle significantly better in the summer months versus the \"xi\" version, and during the winter months, assuming a high performance set of winter tires are used on the SP equipped \"i\", it should at least match (if not exceed) the capabilities of the \"xi\" except in hill climbing and acceleration.\\n\\nSo, it seems that you\\'ve called my bluff and that wasn\\'t my last word after all. ;-)\\n\\nBest Regards,\\nShipo', '\\x85there are six houses on my street that sport driveways that the 530i was completely unable to climb in the snow\\x85 they all have at least a 20% grade between the street and the house.\\n\\nI am pretty darn sure that my Outback with AS performance tires will do a 20 degree hill from a stop in snow.', 'Rolling through the turn, the WT/RWD should have a slight edge due to its lighter weight.\\nAn interesting opinion...

I had an open mind and was open to all options including the G35 Coupe, IS350 the 330i and the A4. I drove all four. Before I took any test drives I was sure I wanted the Lexus. However, once I sat in it and started to drive I knew it was not for me. It felt soft, much like a large family car and the cockpit was very cramped as well as the steering wheel being too small. It has pretty good acceleration but did nothing to inspire me and clearly is not a drivers car.\\n\\nThe 330i was very much a drivers car but I just didn't like the interior that much and truthfully didn't really like the snobby attitude at the dealership so that turned me off to them.\\n\\nThe G35 had tons of torque but the little things really bugged me. For example the power seat controls being located up top and the interior didn't seem to have as high quality materials as the others I had driven. In addition the fuel economy leaves alot to be desired.\\n\\nMy last stop was The Collection. They sell Ferrari, Porsche, Maserati and Audi. No sooner did I walk in when I was being offered coffee and pastrys. The dealership was gorgeous and the sales guy was a no b.s type of guy who I liked. I didn't really like the A4's I saw until I saw one with the S-Line package. Wow! what a looker. The interior was the finest I have ever sat in and it was tight and drove beautifully ( 2.0t , 6 spd). I was sold. I knew Audis depreciate horribly so leasing was the only option for me. They had a great 24 month lease program with 75% residual value and .00139 money factor. That simply cannot be beat. I am driving a 40k car with nothing down and $480 a month as well as free maintenance to boot. Trust me, I was never a fan of Audi but after driving all 4 there was no comparison. Just make sure you get the S line package.\\n\\nGood luck to all.\", 'Sounds like the right choice for you. :shades: Enjoy your ride!', \"you are in the same boat i am in.\\n\\nI have narrowed to the two extremes G35X and the Outback XT Limited for a variety of reasons.

Add in that CR rated the Subaru Outback as one of the most reliable used cars to purchase.\\n\\nI think I can get a G35x for $36K without TTL. I drove that car for an hour the other day. Comfortable, handled well, powerful. And my sister-in-law says it handled beautifully in the snow and ice.

My point was it is closer to 300 than anything else I have looked at, which is quite a bit of juice.\\n\\nOn the $36K, got your point. A relative paid 35.3 or something like that last year.

Powerful engine, but noisy and unrefined at high rpms compared to the 330i and TL. Close to BMW relative to steering / handling. No rear seat headroom.\\n\\n4th Place: Lexus IS350. Biggest negative surprise. No manual transmission? Not even an SMG option? What was Lexus thinking? Salesman claimed that I was \"exactly\" the target market they were shooting for. Yeah, right. Girls can\\'t drive sticks. I said it looked to me like the \"target market\" was testosterone laden guys that have a lead foot and no other driving skills. Too bad. Nice powerful engine, decent handling, best interior, but thanks to automatic transmission, least fun car to drive.\\n\\n5th Place: A4 3.2. Attractive but a little bland exterior. Nice interior. Performance was ho-hum. Felt very heavy. Reliability an issue.\\n\\n6th Place: C350. Everything 2-3 rungs below the 330i, plus terrible reliability record.\\n\\nI\\'ll either go for the 330i or, perhaps, the TL with the idea that if things go well financially, I might go for the new M3 in a couple of years. What do you think?\\n______________________________________\\n\\nThere you have it from one prospecitve buyer who is considerign the entire compact sports sedan market.', 'Thanks for the comparo.\\n\\nI especially enjoyed the Lexus \"I\" remarks.', 'Gotta laugh at the newbie salesman\\'s pathetic comment on \"exact target market.\" The \"target market\" usually do not want to be tagged with the targetting, e.g.: moms don\\'t want Minivans (but secure men with large cargo loads do); the youth don\\'t want cars targetted at youth (but older folks looking for the best bang for the buck do); city dwellers don\\'t want soft-roader crossovers (they want the most impractical offroad heavy machines that hardly ever get taken off the road; whereas the suburbanites with occasional snow and off-road needs actually don\\'t mind getting the soft-roaders). Call it ego or whatever, the salesman should have known better.', 'Interesting, but odd sounding designations IMO. Any guess as to what the hp will be? Over 300 is a given I guess huh?\\n\\nM', 'LOL! You\\'re exactly right about that. I\\'ve heard that the folks at the new Scion brand are upset that their \"youth brand\" is being bought by some retiree-age customers who see the boxy cars as very economical and practical.

As I approached, I was thinking that I hoped the occupants didn't ding my door with their little car. I was surprised when it turned out to be a new 3-series. It was only the second I had seen in person, the first was from the rear on the road. I was struck by how small it seemed and its lack of presence next to my G35. The styling is not attractive to me, and the rear is especially bad. Add to that the fact its way overpriced and it's definitely out as an option when my lease is up in June. I would not even consider the TL because of the FWD HondaAccord platform and the quality issues my friend has had with his (headliner falls down, paint falls off, etc.) The Lexus shotcomings are as you mentioned - it will probably steal some sales from BMW automatic buyers -its styling and size seem similar to the BMW. While the Infiniti coupe is a great looking car, I like the practicality and convenience of the sedan, and IMHO I think the sedan looks better for a sedan than the coupe does for a coupe. I was going to test drive the new 3-series, but that is no longer necessary. It may handle a litte better than the G35, but so does a go cart, and it's not enough better to make a difference when size, styling, and other factors are considered. I am looking forward to a 2007 6MT G35(or G37?)sedan, but I'll exercise my purchase option or get a short lease on a 2006 if I can't get the 2007 before I have to turn my 2003 6MT in. As far as I'm concerned, there are still no real competitors to the G35 in a RWD 6MT sedan.\", '\"As far as I\\'m concerned, there are still no real competitors to the G35 in a RWD 6MT sedan.\"\\n\\nPossibly why you are not called upon by the auto enthusiast press to offer your expertise to the public. This is a fairly pathetic comment that, in combination with the rest of your \"opinion\", holds little value for anyone looking for a realistic review of the distinctions of these fine cars.\\n\\nThe BMW, Lexus, Acura, MB, et al are all fine examples of their maker\\'s take on the small sporty sedan category. They may have a similar mission and respective execution toward that mission may be similar in some respects, but all are not viewed the same by each consumer due to unique qualities of the driving and ownership experinece important to each individual.\\n\\nMy guess is that your perceptions may most likely NOT be widely agreed upon... maybe I\\'m wrong.', 'Paragraphs are helpful things. I\\'ve deleted the rest, but that was the primary point.\\n\\nI\\'m looking forward to buying one of those small cheap (in this case, red) compacts -- a 325i. You probably don\\'t care, but most of the rest of the world does quite nicely with smaller cars with smaller engines. I guess you come from the \"size matters\" school of thought. Let\\'s hear it for \"presence.\"\\n\\nAnother board has put forth the notion that any vehicle with less than 250 hp has no business claiming to be luxury in any shape, manner, or form.

For my money it is the right size and offers what I want and the others don\\'t and again it is my money I am spending. It is like ones opinion whether he likes spinach or the color purple, its not arguable but it may certainly be discussed. If you all want posts with facts than why bother - just go to a car magazine, manufacturers specs etc. I thought these boards were about OPINIONs and impressions. Posts constantly regurgitating the same facts would be boring indeed-ie \"the Infinit has 298 HP, the Lexus has 306 HP\".\\nI was actually looking forward to checking out the new 3-series and I was expressing my dissapointment and I thought I was being respectful and conveying my thoughts about my decision process as other posters are talking about theirs. I was and am really somewhat upset that I find no other alternatives attractive at this time. I did not say that there were no alternatives for others, only that there are none for ME at this time who wants a 6MT sedan (not a coupe), in the right size for me (not too big, not too small), etc. If price were no object and a coupe was desired my First Choice would be an M3 and that is just the right size for that type of car. If you don\\'t want to hear others comparisons/opinions than what\\'s the point of discussing them? I don\\'t think I criticized anyone elses opinion and did not expect to get flamed for apparently having the \"wrong\" opinion. I have been very happy with my choice of a G35 and would not want it to be smaller (or bigger) but I do need to decide on a replacement for it.', 'Not owning any of these cars (I did own a BMW 1600 for 10 years from 1970 to 1980), I have no particular bias one way or the other. As such, I interpreted your first post as simply your opinion why the G35 fits your needs best.\\n\\nUnfortunately, some people don\\'t like it when their opinion of which is the \"best\" car isn\\'t shared by everyone. That\\'s why all these Edmunds forums continue to rehash the same discussions over and over. And probably few, if any, opinions have been changed.', 'How about the fact that a premium pack 330i is $4500 more than a premium pack G35?\\n\\nqbrozen: That might be your reasoning, but the original poster (robertr) never gave that as a reason.

It's really about the price. More for the BMW, less for the Subaru. It seems that over four years, the G35 sedan is evolving into the coupe, with headroom. It's also lighter, and cheaper. Evenso, it has gained weight, (3369 to 3449), and relatively more in the front (52:48 to 53:47). Does anyone know the specific technical differences? One more thing but I digress. Are splash guards really really worth interrupting those clean lines?\", \"Wow, do I envy you.\\n\\nI wish I could decide whether or not a car was worthy of my hard-earned money based simply on seeing one in a lot.
